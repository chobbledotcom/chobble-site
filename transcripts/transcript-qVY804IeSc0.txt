[0:00 - 0:02] All right, this is going to be a bit of
[0:02 - 0:04] a different video from my other ones
[0:04 - 0:06] because I thought what could be quite
[0:06 - 0:09] interesting could be to talk about how I
[0:09 - 0:12] set up my web browser and how you might
[0:12 - 0:14] want to look at setting up your web
[0:14 - 0:17] browser. Because when you're working on
[0:17 - 0:19] promoting your business online, you're
[0:19 - 0:21] going to spend a lot of time in your web
[0:21 - 0:23] browser and a lot of time looking at
[0:23 - 0:25] websites, looking at your own website,
[0:25 - 0:28] browsing the internet. And I think it's
[0:28 - 0:30] important really to make that workflow
[0:30 - 0:33] efficient and pleasant to use.
[0:33 - 0:36] So what we've got here, I'm looking at a
[0:36 - 0:40] freshly installed Firefox on Windows.
[0:40 - 0:43] Firefox is my preferred browser. You
[0:43 - 0:48] might be using Chrome or Brave or Opera
[0:48 - 0:51] or Vivaldi. There's a whole host of
[0:51 - 0:53] options that you could use, but really
[0:53 - 0:56] I'd recommend Firefox. The reason that I
[0:56 - 0:57] would choose Firefox is because Firefox
[0:57 - 0:59] has consistently made changes and
[0:59 - 1:02] improvements to its core program that
[1:02 - 1:06] benefit users of Firefox.
[1:06 - 1:08] While browsers like Chrome, it seems to
[1:08 - 1:11] me, consistently degrade the experience
[1:11 - 1:14] for users and make it harder to have a
[1:14 - 1:17] pleasant to use internet.
[1:17 - 1:19] To get started, the first thing I'd
[1:19 - 1:21] recommend installing on any web browser
[1:21 - 1:24] is a ad blocker. And there's only really
[1:24 - 1:29] one good ad blocker. It's Ublock Origin.
[1:29 - 1:31] You can get to Ublock Origin dead easy.
[1:31 - 1:33] I'm just going to search here on Firefox
[1:33 - 1:36] for Dublock
[1:36 - 1:38] origin.
[1:38 - 1:40] You've got to be careful here that
[1:40 - 1:44] you're installing Ublock Origin and not
[1:44 - 1:48] Ublock. It's got to have origin. And
[1:48 - 1:49] because I'm on Firefox there, I'm going
[1:49 - 1:51] to scroll down a bit and hopefully we'll
[1:51 - 1:53] see the Firefox
[1:53 - 1:56] add-on. There we go. Newblock Origin,
[1:56 - 1:58] this extension for Firefox. Okay. So,
[1:58 - 2:00] once the page is loaded, you'll see here
[2:00 - 2:03] it says add to Firefox. Dead
[2:03 - 2:05] straightforward. Click that big blue
[2:05 - 2:08] button. Big blue button. Click the big
[2:08 - 2:12] blue. Click the big blue button. It pops
[2:12 - 2:15] up here to say add block origin. I'm
[2:15 - 2:16] going to allow it in private windows as
[2:16 - 2:18] well because I want to block adverts
[2:18 - 2:21] everywhere. And then press add.
[2:21 - 2:23] Ublock origin was added.
[2:23 - 2:25] Manage your add-ons and themes through
[2:25 - 2:27] the application menu which is this
[2:27 - 2:29] little jigsaw piece here. You can see
[2:29 - 2:32] here it's added a red shield to the
[2:32 - 2:34] browser. This indicates that the ad
[2:34 - 2:36] blocking is turned on. If you click
[2:36 - 2:38] that, you can turn the power off and on.
[2:38 - 2:40] And you'll see that the shield goes
[2:40 - 2:44] grayed out or red. Red is on. grayed out
[2:44 - 2:46] means it's turned off. So, probably you
[2:46 - 2:49] want to leave it on all the time. And to
[2:49 - 2:50] show you the difference that this makes
[2:50 - 2:52] to a website. And then I'm going to go
[2:52 - 2:55] to a really terrible example of a
[2:55 - 2:58] website for many reasons, but also for
[2:58 - 3:00] the terrible amount of adverts that they
[3:00 - 3:03] got, which is the Daily Mail website,
[3:03 - 3:06] dailymail.co.uk.
[3:07 - 3:09] And we can see now it's taking a long
[3:09 - 3:12] time to load.
[3:15 - 3:17] We've got a big advert at the top for a
[3:17 - 3:19] sofa. We've got a video that
[3:19 - 3:21] automatically plays for an advert. Got
[3:21 - 3:24] casino adverts. Got some adverts of some
[3:24 - 3:26] HR software.
[3:26 - 3:28] It's actually making my browser quite
[3:28 - 3:31] slow to use.
[3:31 - 3:33] The page is very very busy
[3:33 - 3:35] and there's adverts all over the show
[3:35 - 3:38] basically.
[3:38 - 3:40] Oh my.
[3:40 - 3:42] And now let's see what a difference it
[3:42 - 3:44] makes when I turn the ad blocker back on
[3:44 - 3:47] again.
[3:50 - 3:52] Reload the page.
[3:52 - 3:55] We can see we've got now a really clean,
[3:55 - 3:57] nice interface
[3:57 - 4:01] with no adverts. Super fast to load.
[4:01 - 4:03] Awesome.
[4:03 - 4:05] So, there's many benefits to having an
[4:05 - 4:08] ad blocker. The first is that adverts
[4:08 - 4:11] are annoying, but the second is that
[4:11 - 4:13] downloading the adverts is work that
[4:13 - 4:15] your computer has to do. By blocking the
[4:15 - 4:17] adverts, you can make the internet in
[4:17 - 4:20] general much faster to use. If you've
[4:20 - 4:22] got an old computer, this can make loads
[4:22 - 4:24] of difference to how pleasant the
[4:24 - 4:26] internet is to use. We can see here that
[4:26 - 4:29] Ublock keeps a count of how many adverts
[4:29 - 4:31] have been blocked. And on the daily mail
[4:31 - 4:33] page, it's 192 different scripts have
[4:33 - 4:36] been blocked. That's a lot of work that
[4:36 - 4:38] your computer doesn't have to do to
[4:38 - 4:42] install those adverts.
[4:42 - 4:44] Okay, the next extension that I think is
[4:44 - 4:47] essential is called I still don't care
[4:47 - 4:49] about cookies. But since we're already
[4:49 - 4:52] on the Firefox browser add-ons website,
[4:52 - 4:54] we can search in the top right here for
[4:54 - 4:58] I still don't. And we'll see that it's
[4:58 - 5:00] suggesting I still don't care about
[5:00 - 5:03] cookies. There's two extensions. There's
[5:03 - 5:04] one called I don't care about cookies,
[5:04 - 5:06] one called I still don't care about
[5:06 - 5:09] cookies. The still is the better one.
[5:09 - 5:11] What this extension does is
[5:11 - 5:14] automatically click away cookie banners
[5:14 - 5:15] that pop up when you browse the
[5:15 - 5:17] internet.
[5:17 - 5:19] The cookie banners that exist because of
[5:19 - 5:22] GDPR, but really it's because companies
[5:22 - 5:23] want to track you around the internet
[5:23 - 5:25] make the internet really annoying to
[5:25 - 5:28] use. Installing this extension, I still
[5:28 - 5:31] don't care about cookies
[5:31 - 5:34] fixes that problem altogether.
[5:34 - 5:36] So, it's just like Origin. We'll click
[5:36 - 5:38] add to Firefox.
[5:38 - 5:40] It pops up here to say do we want to add
[5:40 - 5:42] it? We'll click the blue button again to
[5:42 - 5:46] say do we want to add it?
[5:46 - 5:50] Sorted. It's added.
[5:56 - 5:58] So you'll see there as a loaded CNN.com
[5:58 - 6:00] the cookie banner popped up and was
[6:00 - 6:04] immediately clicked away automatically.
[6:04 - 6:07] Awesome.
[6:07 - 6:09] And another example
[6:09 - 6:14] let's try independent
[6:16 - 6:18] copy pops up and it is immediately
[6:18 - 6:20] clicked away. So you're never bothered
[6:20 - 6:23] by the cookie banners. Awesome
[6:23 - 6:25] extension.
[6:25 - 6:27] So we got that by searching for I still
[6:27 - 6:29] don't care about cookies and installing
[6:29 - 6:32] the Firefox browser add-on version.
[6:32 - 6:34] Just to clarify, I could go on
[6:34 - 6:36] google.com here and I can search for I
[6:36 - 6:40] still don't care about cookies.
[6:40 - 6:41] And there's also a Chrome version here
[6:41 - 6:44] that you can install if you use Chrome.
[6:44 - 6:45] And if I scroll down, there's probably
[6:45 - 6:50] also a version for Edge. Yep, there's a
[6:50 - 6:52] version for Edge or version for Opera.
[6:52 - 6:55] So, whichever browser you're using,
[6:55 - 6:57] there's probably a way to install these
[6:57 - 6:59] extensions that I'm talking about. I'm
[6:59 - 7:00] talking about them for Firefox, though,
[7:00 - 7:03] because I think Firefox is the best
[7:03 - 7:06] browser.
[7:06 - 7:08] Okay, so we've now got rid of annoying
[7:08 - 7:09] cookie banners. We've got rid of
[7:09 - 7:11] adverts. The next thing I want to talk
[7:11 - 7:14] about is bookmarking pages.
[7:14 - 7:16] It's likely that when you're browsing
[7:16 - 7:17] the internet, there's going to be a
[7:17 - 7:19] whole bunch of different websites that
[7:19 - 7:23] you're going to need to visit regularly.
[7:23 - 7:26] Bookmarking those pages is the way to
[7:26 - 7:28] make this easier. It might sound obvious
[7:28 - 7:30] to bookmark the pages that you visit,
[7:30 - 7:32] but it took me a while to get into the
[7:32 - 7:34] habit of it really.
[7:34 - 7:36] If I open a new tab here in Firefox,
[7:36 - 7:38] we'll see it pops up with the bookmark
[7:38 - 7:40] bar which by which by default just shows
[7:40 - 7:44] import bookmarks and getting started to
[7:44 - 7:47] default bookmarks that Firefox give you.
[7:47 - 7:49] If I wanted to log into my website,
[7:49 - 7:54] let's say my website is at trouble.com
[7:54 - 7:56] and I want to visit this regularly. I
[7:56 - 8:00] click the star icon here
[8:00 - 8:01] and it'll ask me where I want to store
[8:01 - 8:03] this bookmark and I can say in the
[8:03 - 8:05] toolbar
[8:05 - 8:09] in the menu or in other bookmarks
[8:09 - 8:11] or somewhere else I can choose. So I'm
[8:11 - 8:13] going to store it in the toolbar for now
[8:13 - 8:14] just to show you. And I'll put the name
[8:14 - 8:17] as Chubble.
[8:19 - 8:21] And we see there popped up Chubble. And
[8:21 - 8:23] now whenever I like I can click Chubble
[8:23 - 8:25] and I'll be taken straight to this
[8:25 - 8:27] website.
[8:27 - 8:30] What I like to do as well is bookmark
[8:30 - 8:33] pages that are useful to me that save me
[8:33 - 8:35] some clicks. So now I'm on the website
[8:35 - 8:38] of crystal.io, which is my domain name
[8:38 - 8:39] registar.
[8:39 - 8:41] And to save me having to click login
[8:41 - 8:45] each time, I can click login once,
[8:45 - 8:48] then click continue to login
[8:48 - 8:51] and bookmark this page.
[8:51 - 8:55] And now I only have to click I can I'll
[8:55 - 9:00] save the name as Crystal login.
[9:00 - 9:02] And now I can click that and be taken
[9:02 - 9:05] straight to the page to log into my
[9:05 - 9:07] domain name hosting, which saves me two
[9:07 - 9:09] clicks every time that I want to go
[9:09 - 9:11] through. By default in Firefox, the
[9:11 - 9:14] bookmark toolbar only shows on new tabs,
[9:14 - 9:17] but you can right click on it. Go down
[9:17 - 9:18] to the bookmarks toolbar option and then
[9:18 - 9:20] choose always show if you want it to
[9:20 - 9:23] always show. The next critical thing I
[9:23 - 9:24] think everyone should have on their web
[9:24 - 9:27] browser is a password manager. Password
[9:27 - 9:29] managers are built into web browsers by
[9:29 - 9:31] default. If you go to any kind of login
[9:31 - 9:36] page, if I go to my source code
[9:36 - 9:38] and click sign in here, I'll put some
[9:38 - 9:41] nonsense. Test test test.
[9:41 - 9:43] Click sign in. You'll see it asks me if
[9:43 - 9:45] I want to save the password. This just
[9:45 - 9:48] saves it into my web browser. That's a
[9:48 - 9:49] little bit handy, but it could be much
[9:49 - 9:52] better. For example, I might want to
[9:52 - 9:54] sync that password across all of my
[9:54 - 9:57] devices. You can do that within Firefox
[9:57 - 10:00] by using Firefox sync. If I click the
[10:00 - 10:03] menu here and click sync and save data
[10:03 - 10:06] here and sign in,
[10:06 - 10:09] you can create a Mozilla account and
[10:09 - 10:11] through this Mosilla account, you can
[10:11 - 10:14] sync your passwords, tabs, and bookmarks
[10:14 - 10:17] across anywhere that you use Firefox. If
[10:17 - 10:18] you've got multiple computers, you can
[10:18 - 10:21] sync that data between them. But it also
[10:21 - 10:23] works as a backup in case your computer
[10:23 - 10:27] ever gets lost or broken. The passwords
[10:27 - 10:29] and important data will be synced into
[10:29 - 10:31] Firefox. Storing your passwords in a
[10:31 - 10:33] password manager means that it's just a
[10:33 - 10:35] couple of clicks to log into the sites
[10:35 - 10:37] that you visit regularly. But rather
[10:37 - 10:39] than using Firefox password manager, I
[10:39 - 10:41] prefer to use Bitwarden
[10:41 - 10:44] at bitwen.com.
[10:44 - 10:46] Bit warden is an open-source password
[10:46 - 10:49] manager that's free.
[10:49 - 10:52] If you click view plans and pricing
[10:52 - 10:54] and personal,
[10:54 - 10:56] you'll see it's free. With all of the
[10:56 - 10:59] core functions included,
[10:59 - 11:01] Bitboard lets you protect all of your
[11:01 - 11:03] passwords behind one secure master
[11:03 - 11:05] password. And then you only need to
[11:05 - 11:08] remember that one master password. This
[11:08 - 11:10] means that all of your other passwords
[11:10 - 11:12] can be totally random gobbledegook that
[11:12 - 11:14] you never have to remember. You just
[11:14 - 11:16] click the button to automatically log
[11:16 - 11:18] into the site. You've already authorized
[11:18 - 11:19] it through your Bit Warden browser
[11:19 - 11:21] extension.
[11:21 - 11:23] Getting into the ins and outs of biting
[11:23 - 11:25] is probably a bit much for this video,
[11:25 - 11:27] but it won't take you long and you can
[11:27 - 11:29] gradually migrate your passwords over to
[11:29 - 11:30] it. So, you don't need to feel like you
[11:30 - 11:33] need to change everything all at once.
[11:33 - 11:35] All right, as always, I hope this was
[11:35 - 11:36] useful. If you've got any questions,
[11:36 - 11:39] please drop us a message. And if you
[11:39 - 11:40] think of anything that you'd like me to
[11:40 - 11:42] talk about in a video, please drop me a
[11:42 - 11:43] message as well. I'm totally up for any
[11:43 - 11:46] ideas or suggestions that people have.
[11:46 - 11:49] Cheers.
