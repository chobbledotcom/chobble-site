[0:03 - 0:05] okay this is my fourth attempt at
[0:05 - 0:07] recording this Um I've had a decorator
[0:07 - 0:09] around all day today so the house has
[0:09 - 0:11] been super busy I tried recording it out
[0:11 - 0:14] in the park nearby Um and then it
[0:14 - 0:16] started raining so I went to my back
[0:16 - 0:17] garden and then the neighbors out the
[0:17 - 0:20] back were being noisy because they're
[0:20 - 0:21] getting the house
[0:21 - 0:24] rebuilt Anyway so today I'm going to
[0:24 - 0:27] talk about Google Search Console This is
[0:27 - 0:30] a free tool that Google provide where
[0:30 - 0:31] you can log in and you can learn about
[0:31 - 0:33] how Google views your site in terms of
[0:33 - 0:35] search results If you're trying to get
[0:35 - 0:38] your website ranking well and attracting
[0:38 - 0:40] visitors then I think that you really
[0:40 - 0:41] ought to pay some attention to Google
[0:41 - 0:42] Search Console because it can give you
[0:42 - 0:44] some really useful
[0:44 - 0:47] insights At an absolute bare minimum
[0:47 - 0:49] someone should be paying attention to
[0:49 - 0:50] the emails that Google Search Console
[0:50 - 0:52] sends and fixing any problems that they
[0:52 - 0:55] mention If I host your website then I'm
[0:55 - 0:57] doing that for you And if you want
[0:57 - 0:59] access to Google Search Console then
[0:59 - 1:00] just drop me a message and I'll invite
[1:00 - 1:02] you to the
[1:02 - 1:05] account But ideally everyone involved in
[1:05 - 1:06] your website should have access to
[1:06 - 1:08] Google Search Console and should
[1:08 - 1:11] periodically log in and check how things
[1:11 - 1:12] are looking Just receiving the
[1:12 - 1:14] notification emails that they send you
[1:14 - 1:17] is one thing but being proactive about
[1:17 - 1:18] the things that you can learn through
[1:18 - 1:20] Google Search Console is really
[1:20 - 1:23] beneficial
[1:23 - 1:25] Okay to sign up you're going to need a
[1:25 - 1:27] Google account You probably got a Google
[1:27 - 1:30] account You uh need one for a Gmail
[1:30 - 1:32] address or a YouTube account or an
[1:32 - 1:36] Android phone You need to visit
[1:36 - 1:39] search.google.com/sarch console And then
[1:39 - 1:42] you'll click start now and log into your
[1:42 - 1:43] Google
[1:43 - 1:46] account So once you're in Google will
[1:46 - 1:48] ask you if you want to add a property
[1:48 - 1:50] I'll show you what that menu looks like
[1:50 - 1:52] So here it will ask you whether you've
[1:52 - 1:56] got a domain or an ear prefix property A
[1:56 - 1:58] property is really just another word for
[1:58 - 2:01] a website Google wants to verify that
[2:01 - 2:03] you own the website And so they give you
[2:03 - 2:04] some options about how you can
[2:04 - 2:07] accomplish this There's two options Like
[2:07 - 2:09] I said domain
[2:09 - 2:12] prefix For most small businesses that
[2:12 - 2:14] just have one website there isn't much
[2:14 - 2:16] difference in how these work and either
[2:16 - 2:18] would be fine
[2:18 - 2:21] The first option domain verification
[2:21 - 2:23] means that you need to add a DNS record
[2:23 - 2:25] to your domain name This is a slightly
[2:25 - 2:28] fiddly process Google give you
[2:28 - 2:30] instructions on how to do it but you'll
[2:30 - 2:31] need to click around in menus in your
[2:31 - 2:33] domain name control panel and there's a
[2:33 - 2:34] chance that you won't be able to do it
[2:34 - 2:36] if someone else controls the site's name
[2:36 - 2:38] servers which is a whole technical
[2:38 - 2:39] rabbit hole that's too much to get into
[2:39 - 2:43] here The second option Earl prefix is a
[2:43 - 2:46] bit easier This lets you verify by
[2:46 - 2:48] adding a meta tag to your site's HTML
[2:48 - 2:50] source code or by connecting it to your
[2:50 - 2:52] Google Analytics account or Google
[2:52 - 2:55] Adwords Or you can do the DNS method
[2:55 - 2:57] from the domain verification too
[2:57 - 2:59] Whichever option you go for there's a
[2:59 - 3:00] pretty good chance that you're going to
[3:00 - 3:02] need to get whoever made your website to
[3:02 - 3:05] help you But it's only a quick job and
[3:05 - 3:06] it only needs doing once and then it's
[3:06 - 3:07] good
[3:07 - 3:09] forever All right so we've got the
[3:09 - 3:12] domain verified Nice Let me just do that
[3:12 - 3:15] for one here
[3:18 - 3:20] example.co Nice Your domain is verified
[3:20 - 3:22] I'm going to click go to property
[3:22 - 3:24] here So when you log in you'll probably
[3:24 - 3:26] see this as well where it says
[3:26 - 3:28] processing data Please check again in a
[3:28 - 3:31] day or so In my experience it always
[3:31 - 3:33] takes more than a day for any useful
[3:33 - 3:35] information to show up I don't know why
[3:35 - 3:36] that's this is because Google has all
[3:36 - 3:38] that information And once it's showing
[3:38 - 3:39] you might actually be able to see
[3:39 - 3:41] information from before you set up
[3:41 - 3:43] Google Search Console But anyway check
[3:43 - 3:47] back in a couple of days Okay so a
[3:47 - 3:49] couple of days have passed and we're in
[3:49 - 3:49] the
[3:49 - 3:51] console
[3:51 - 3:53] Terrific So first off you'll be looking
[3:53 - 3:56] at this overview graph this overview
[3:56 - 3:58] page sorry which gives you a couple of
[3:58 - 3:59] graphs that show how many clicks your
[3:59 - 4:01] site
[4:01 - 4:03] got And it shows how many pages are
[4:03 - 4:05] indexed and not
[4:05 - 4:08] indexed and it shows how fast your site
[4:08 - 4:10] was for visitors And if your site
[4:10 - 4:12] contains structured data you'll this
[4:12 - 4:14] will show up in the enhancement section
[4:14 - 4:16] That's another big rabbit hole that we
[4:16 - 4:18] don't want to get distracted by just now
[4:18 - 4:20] Okay so let's go through the pages on
[4:20 - 4:23] Google search console in order First off
[4:23 - 4:24] there's Earl
[4:24 - 4:27] inspection So you can type any web
[4:27 - 4:29] address on your website in here and
[4:29 - 4:30] it'll tell you whether that page shows
[4:30 - 4:32] in Google search results whether it's in
[4:32 - 4:34] their index And if the answer to either
[4:34 - 4:36] of those questions is no it'll tell you
[4:36 - 4:39] why
[4:39 - 4:41] It also tells you a few things about why
[4:41 - 4:43] this page is in the index If it is in
[4:43 - 4:46] the index Google indexes pages because
[4:46 - 4:48] other pages link to them The internet is
[4:48 - 4:50] a web of pages linked into each other
[4:50 - 4:52] And this page will tell you which pages
[4:52 - 4:54] linked to the one in question which
[4:54 - 4:56] Google followed to learn about
[4:56 - 4:59] it This isn't
[4:59 - 5:00] comprehensive but if you're wondering
[5:00 - 5:02] why a page that you didn't expect to
[5:02 - 5:04] show in search results is showing this
[5:04 - 5:05] can hint at
[5:05 - 5:08] why It also tells you the canonical
[5:08 - 5:11] address of the page It's likely that
[5:11 - 5:13] pages on your website can be accessed at
[5:13 - 5:14] a few different addresses Like your
[5:14 - 5:16] domain probably works fine with or
[5:16 - 5:19] without the www before your the domain
[5:19 - 5:22] name or with and without a slash at the
[5:22 - 5:24] end of the address and then a whole
[5:24 - 5:27] bunch more technical examples And the
[5:27 - 5:30] canonical address is the one of those
[5:30 - 5:32] that Google decides is the main
[5:32 - 5:35] authoritative version of your page So
[5:35 - 5:36] generally with a web page you want this
[5:36 - 5:39] all to just make sense Like if your
[5:39 - 5:41] canonical shows a domain which you don't
[5:41 - 5:42] recognize as your main one that needs
[5:42 - 5:44] fixing as soon as
[5:44 - 5:47] possible Or if a page shows that Google
[5:47 - 5:49] wasn't allowed to crawl it or wasn't
[5:49 - 5:52] allowed to fetch it then you probably
[5:52 - 5:54] want to dig into that Something might
[5:54 - 5:57] have gone wrong You can also request
[5:57 - 5:59] indexing on this page if the page has
[5:59 - 6:01] changed and you want Google to quickly
[6:01 - 6:03] fetch and show the newest version
[6:03 - 6:04] Although I get weird errors with this
[6:04 - 6:06] button pretty often so your mileage may
[6:06 - 6:10] vary Let's see what it does
[6:11 - 6:14] here It takes a while too It did
[6:14 - 6:17] something Last time I tried it it showed
[6:17 - 6:20] me a weird error Okay
[6:23 - 6:26] cool All right so next up we've got
[6:26 - 6:28] performance This is probably the coolest
[6:28 - 6:31] page in Google Search Console
[6:31 - 6:34] This shows which search terms your page
[6:34 - 6:37] showed up for and appeared in search
[6:37 - 6:40] Google search results and it shows how
[6:40 - 6:43] often it shows showed and how many
[6:43 - 6:44] people click through So that's
[6:44 - 6:46] impressions and
[6:46 - 6:48] clicks So you can view up to the last 16
[6:48 - 6:52] months of data in here So it's really
[6:52 - 6:55] good for plotting long-term trends So we
[6:55 - 6:57] can see here something changed at the
[6:57 - 6:59] start of October last year which meant
[6:59 - 7:00] that beast started getting a lot more
[7:00 - 7:03] impressions but not many more
[7:03 - 7:06] clicks
[7:06 - 7:08] Anyway by default this page shows the
[7:08 - 7:10] queries that people search for down here
[7:10 - 7:12] in the query
[7:12 - 7:14] section A lot of these is probably what
[7:14 - 7:16] you'd expect is people searching for
[7:16 - 7:18] variations of the business name like
[7:18 - 7:20] this and that this and that this and
[7:20 - 7:22] that this and that this and that and
[7:22 - 7:25] that this and that this and that and you
[7:25 - 7:28] you know are searching for the exact
[7:28 - 7:30] service that you offer as well So if we
[7:30 - 7:32] go to the next page we'll probably see
[7:32 - 7:34] Ryson 3 Manchester which is the type of
[7:34 - 7:35] curry that they
[7:35 - 7:38] do But you'll probably find that your
[7:38 - 7:39] site also shows for things that you
[7:39 - 7:41] never expected like maybe a specific
[7:41 - 7:44] accreditation that your site mentions or
[7:44 - 7:45] a specific about a service that you
[7:45 - 7:48] offer Being informed about the kind of
[7:48 - 7:50] things that people are searching for
[7:50 - 7:52] that your website is showing up for can
[7:52 - 7:54] be really useful in terms of helping you
[7:54 - 7:55] plan improvements to your
[7:55 - 7:58] website Like maybe your website doesn't
[7:58 - 8:00] have as much good content about it about
[8:00 - 8:02] a certain service as the potential
[8:02 - 8:05] profits from that service could warrant
[8:05 - 8:06] Just learning that people are actually
[8:06 - 8:08] searching for the profitable service
[8:08 - 8:10] might encourage you to think about how
[8:10 - 8:11] your site could address that searcher's
[8:11 - 8:14] needs somehow
[8:14 - 8:17] The next tab along performance is
[8:17 - 8:20] pages This shows the landing pages on
[8:20 - 8:22] your site That's the pages that people
[8:22 - 8:25] clicked on or landed on after clicking a
[8:25 - 8:27] search result You might be surprised at
[8:27 - 8:28] which sections of your site attract
[8:28 - 8:32] visitors and which
[8:32 - 8:34] don't You can also see which countries
[8:34 - 8:37] people came from If you see that your
[8:37 - 8:39] site is attracting a lot of visitors
[8:39 - 8:41] from a country where you don't do any
[8:41 - 8:42] business then you might want to filter
[8:42 - 8:45] this page to only show visitors from
[8:45 - 8:47] your home
[8:47 - 8:50] country cuz those are the ones that it's
[8:50 - 8:52] worth optimizing your site towards Okay
[8:52 - 8:55] the next tab is devices Nowadays it's
[8:55 - 8:57] likely that a substantial amount of your
[8:57 - 8:59] site visitors will be on mobile devices
[8:59 - 9:02] Here we can see there's nearly 40,000
[9:02 - 9:05] mobile visitors and 11,000 12,000
[9:05 - 9:06] desktop
[9:06 - 9:10] ones So your site should work as good on
[9:10 - 9:12] mobiles as it does on desktops And you
[9:12 - 9:13] should be sure to check it out on both
[9:13 - 9:15] pretty regularly so you're aware of the
[9:15 - 9:18] experience that your visitors are
[9:18 - 9:20] getting Search appearance probably won't
[9:20 - 9:22] show anything for your site unless
[9:22 - 9:23] you're a very big company that shows up
[9:23 - 9:27] in Google news posts
[9:27 - 9:29] And then dates just let you see how many
[9:29 - 9:32] clicks and impressions you got each
[9:33 - 9:36] day Up at the top we can select to show
[9:36 - 9:39] the average click-through ratio CTR and
[9:39 - 9:41] the average
[9:41 - 9:43] position That's what your ranking
[9:43 - 9:44] position
[9:44 - 9:47] was Unless you filter down to a specific
[9:47 - 9:49] keyword I don't think these graphs are
[9:49 - 9:51] very much use But once you do filter
[9:51 - 9:53] down to a keyword then I think it can be
[9:53 - 9:55] quite interesting to see No actually
[9:55 - 9:58] that wasn't a good example but it can be
[9:58 - 9:59] quite interesting to see how your
[9:59 - 10:01] position or your ranking has changed for
[10:01 - 10:04] a keyword over a period of
[10:04 - 10:07] time but you need to have a quite a lot
[10:07 - 10:09] of clicks for these graphs to be much
[10:09 - 10:12] use And you know like you can see here
[10:12 - 10:15] it wasn't much use with
[10:16 - 10:19] that Okay that's
[10:19 - 10:22] indexing Oh this discover tab also not
[10:22 - 10:25] going to show much for um the majority
[10:25 - 10:28] of small business websites This is about
[10:28 - 10:30] Google News and
[10:30 - 10:34] stuff Okay indexing and
[10:34 - 10:37] pages So next up this is the most the
[10:37 - 10:39] second most important section on Google
[10:39 - 10:42] Search Console indexing This
[10:42 - 10:45] shows how many pages are and aren't
[10:45 - 10:46] indexed on your site And you can click
[10:46 - 10:50] through and see examples of each of them
[10:50 - 10:51] Hopefully there's no surprises under the
[10:51 - 10:54] indexed pages Unless your site is really
[10:54 - 10:56] massive with hundreds of pages it should
[10:56 - 10:58] be easy enough to scan over this list of
[10:58 - 11:00] pages and make sure that they all make
[11:00 - 11:01] sense to you that they're all pages that
[11:01 - 11:04] you expect to see on your
[11:04 - 11:08] website The notindexed section can be
[11:08 - 11:10] interesting There's a few reasons why a
[11:10 - 11:12] page might not be indexed and some of
[11:12 - 11:13] these are no big deal but others are
[11:13 - 11:14] worth
[11:14 - 11:17] investigating For example redirects one
[11:17 - 11:19] page might redirect to another page like
[11:19 - 11:22] when the www version of your website
[11:22 - 11:24] works just the same as the www
[11:24 - 11:27] version and if that's the case then the
[11:27 - 11:29] source might be shown as a page with
[11:29 - 11:31] redirect as it's the reason for not
[11:31 - 11:34] being indexed but that's all fine here
[11:34 - 11:37] we can see under this restaurant sites
[11:37 - 11:40] that some of these pages just variations
[11:40 - 11:43] of old ears and it's normally enough for
[11:43 - 11:47] those to be redirected or it might a not
[11:47 - 11:50] found a 404 error
[11:50 - 11:53] page This isn't ne necessarily a bad
[11:53 - 11:55] thing either It could be a page that
[11:55 - 11:57] you've deleted which is fine to show a
[11:57 - 12:00] not found message for but you might want
[12:00 - 12:01] to test that message yourself and make
[12:01 - 12:02] sure that it's
[12:02 - 12:05] friendly It's worth mentioning that just
[12:05 - 12:08] because Google shows that a page was not
[12:08 - 12:10] found that doesn't necessarily mean that
[12:10 - 12:12] it's anything that you've done In this
[12:12 - 12:15] example here this is not showing as this
[12:15 - 12:18] is showing as not found because a
[12:18 - 12:20] website that links to this and that has
[12:20 - 12:24] a broken uh website earlier with some
[12:24 - 12:26] gobbledegook So that's ended up in
[12:26 - 12:28] Google's index but it's not a problem
[12:28 - 12:30] that that has been caused by the
[12:30 - 12:34] restaurant or a page could be blocked by
[12:34 - 12:37] robots text or excluded by a no index
[12:37 - 12:39] tag
[12:39 - 12:41] These are technical measures that your
[12:41 - 12:43] web host might use to stop Google from
[12:43 - 12:45] indexing certain pages like the thank
[12:45 - 12:48] you page for your contact form perhaps
[12:48 - 12:51] or technical pages to do with the
[12:51 - 12:53] internals of your website Say we've got
[12:53 - 12:55] a Trip Advisor frame as being blocked on
[12:55 - 12:58] the this cafe's website But if pages
[12:58 - 12:59] that you think are important are showing
[12:59 - 13:02] as blocked or no indexed then something
[13:02 - 13:05] is wrong
[13:05 - 13:06] The examples I've talked about so far
[13:06 - 13:10] will all show website in the source
[13:10 - 13:12] column This means that Google
[13:12 - 13:13] interpreted a signal from the website
[13:13 - 13:16] about which pages to show or not But
[13:16 - 13:17] there could be pages in there with
[13:17 - 13:20] Google systems as as the source meaning
[13:20 - 13:21] Google's algorithm determined that the
[13:21 - 13:24] page shouldn't be indexed These might
[13:24 - 13:26] say things like crawled currently not
[13:26 - 13:27] indexed or discovered currently not
[13:27 - 13:30] indexed
[13:30 - 13:32] Google probably won't give much
[13:32 - 13:33] information about why their algorithms
[13:33 - 13:35] decided that these pages shouldn't show
[13:35 - 13:37] But in my experience it's usually
[13:37 - 13:39] because the content isn't very good Like
[13:39 - 13:41] maybe the page contains hardly any
[13:41 - 13:43] unique content or maybe it's keyword
[13:43 - 13:44] stuffed and it doesn't provide much
[13:44 - 13:46] value to the visitor or maybe just looks
[13:46 - 13:49] a bit low quality to Google If you spot
[13:49 - 13:50] pages that aren't being indexed in the
[13:50 - 13:52] sources Google systems it's usually a
[13:52 - 13:54] good indicator that those pages need
[13:54 - 13:57] some love In this case it's a 404 page
[13:57 - 13:59] that's showing here So that's fine to
[13:59 - 14:01] not be
[14:02 - 14:06] indexed All right next up site maps
[14:06 - 14:08] There's a chance that your site has a
[14:08 - 14:10] site map which is a way to tell search
[14:10 - 14:12] engines all about the pages on your site
[14:12 - 14:15] It's literally a map of the site If your
[14:15 - 14:17] site has one then you can add its
[14:17 - 14:18] address here and Google will
[14:18 - 14:20] periodically check it This can be a good
[14:20 - 14:22] way to speed up the processing of new
[14:22 - 14:24] pages being added to the Google index
[14:24 - 14:26] But it's not the end of the world if you
[14:26 - 14:28] don't have one If your site does have
[14:28 - 14:29] one there's a fair chance that it lives
[14:29 - 14:32] at your domain name followed by a slash
[14:32 - 14:34] and then
[14:34 - 14:36] sitemap.xml You can always test that
[14:36 - 14:39] address in the box here if you're
[14:40 - 14:43] unsure Okay next we've got the removals
[14:43 - 14:46] tool The removals tool is a spot where
[14:46 - 14:48] you can submit requests to Google for
[14:48 - 14:50] them to remove pages on your site from
[14:50 - 14:53] their index or to update the snippet in
[14:53 - 14:55] search results if it's showing outdated
[14:55 - 14:57] text If any of the content on your site
[14:57 - 14:59] has been filtered by safe search
[14:59 - 15:01] Google's adult content filter it'll show
[15:01 - 15:03] in here as
[15:03 - 15:05] well Okay I'm going to skip a bunch of
[15:05 - 15:08] these other options here Go web vitals
[15:08 - 15:11] HTTPS manual actions security issues
[15:11 - 15:14] because they're not super important to
[15:14 - 15:16] the majority of small business websites
[15:16 - 15:17] and they're quite technical Probably a
[15:17 - 15:19] bit too much to get into this
[15:19 - 15:24] post And now let's get into links
[15:24 - 15:26] This page tells you a fair bit about the
[15:26 - 15:28] links that are pointing to your website
[15:28 - 15:30] which sites link to you which pages they
[15:30 - 15:33] link to and what text they use Like
[15:33 - 15:34] everything else on Google Search Console
[15:34 - 15:36] you should click around in here and make
[15:36 - 15:38] sure that nothing surprises you Like if
[15:38 - 15:40] you see a website that you don't
[15:40 - 15:42] recognize but is linking to you then
[15:42 - 15:44] maybe it's worth investigating that a
[15:44 - 15:46] bit You might be able to improve your
[15:46 - 15:48] listing on the website during the link
[15:48 - 15:49] Or maybe it's somewhere that customers
[15:49 - 15:51] can leave reviews or where you can log
[15:51 - 15:54] in and edit a profile
[15:54 - 15:56] It's worth being aware of the places
[15:56 - 15:57] that are linking to your site and making
[15:57 - 15:59] sure that they all represent you as best
[15:59 - 16:01] as they possibly
[16:01 - 16:04] can All right hopefully that gives you a
[16:04 - 16:05] pretty good overview of Google Search
[16:05 - 16:07] Console and the reasons why it's worth
[16:07 - 16:08] paying attention to The very last thing
[16:08 - 16:10] that I'd ask you to check is to click
[16:10 - 16:12] the user settings icon at the top of the
[16:12 - 16:14] page and making sure it says all emails
[16:14 - 16:18] are enabled under email preferences
[16:18 - 16:19] For a few months after you first sign up
[16:19 - 16:21] for Google Search Console they'll send
[16:21 - 16:22] you occasional emails about how your
[16:22 - 16:25] site is performing And these can contain
[16:25 - 16:27] some pretty interesting statistics and
[16:27 - 16:29] details But long-term they'll also email
[16:29 - 16:31] you if something needs your attention
[16:31 - 16:33] about your website Google Search Console
[16:33 - 16:35] is the only way to get notified For
[16:35 - 16:37] example if your site gets penalized for
[16:37 - 16:40] doing something spammy or if something
[16:40 - 16:42] changes on your site by mistake and
[16:42 - 16:44] pages end up not being indexable this is
[16:44 - 16:46] the only place that you'll find out So
[16:46 - 16:48] keep those notifications turned on and
[16:48 - 16:51] pay attention to the emails that they
[16:51 - 16:54] send All right as ever I hope this was
[16:54 - 16:57] useful Any questions drop me a message
[16:57 - 17:00] Cheers
