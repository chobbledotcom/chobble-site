[0:00 - 0:02] Okay, today I'm going to talk about
[0:02 - 0:05] Google business profile.
[0:05 - 0:08] This is basically Google Maps. For lots
[0:08 - 0:09] of search terms on Google, they'll give
[0:09 - 0:13] a lot of priority to maps listings or
[0:13 - 0:15] Google business listings. So here, for
[0:15 - 0:17] example, I've searched for plumber. And
[0:17 - 0:19] you can see that it's got this kind of
[0:19 - 0:22] rubbish AI overview about what a plumber
[0:22 - 0:24] is. And then the next result is check a
[0:24 - 0:27] trade. And we've got some links to
[0:27 - 0:30] search checker, trusted pilot, yell. And
[0:30 - 0:33] then the next result is this list of
[0:33 - 0:35] businesses. And these are all Google
[0:35 - 0:38] business profiles.
[0:38 - 0:40] So Northwest Plumbing, JC Plumbing,
[0:40 - 0:41] Allen Plumbing, and you'll see as well
[0:41 - 0:44] that these are all local to me.
[0:44 - 0:45] Manchester, let's see where these guys
[0:45 - 0:48] are on the list. So here's one over
[0:48 - 0:50] towards Rushdale,
[0:50 - 0:53] around me here, and up towards Bur. So
[0:53 - 0:55] Google is knows without me having
[0:55 - 0:58] written anything about PressWitch here
[0:58 - 1:00] that I'm in Preswitch which is in
[1:00 - 1:02] Manchester near and you can see here
[1:02 - 1:04] it's also suggesting Bar Rcliffe these
[1:04 - 1:06] local search terms and then it's
[1:06 - 1:09] prioritizing these Google business
[1:09 - 1:12] listings which appear before the organic
[1:12 - 1:13] search results which is like that's
[1:13 - 1:15] quite far down the page. So I had to
[1:15 - 1:17] scroll there to see the organic search
[1:17 - 1:19] results.
[1:19 - 1:21] On this next tab I've got electrician.
[1:21 - 1:23] Here I've searched for electrician. I've
[1:23 - 1:26] got the AI overview thing as well. And
[1:26 - 1:28] then the same kind of thing. Search,
[1:28 - 1:29] check a trade, search trust a trader,
[1:29 - 1:32] search bar, and then businesses. And
[1:32 - 1:34] it's listing electricians near me. And
[1:34 - 1:36] again, these are Google business
[1:36 - 1:38] profiles. And then we've got the organic
[1:38 - 1:40] results after those checker trade. The
[1:40 - 1:42] organic results even are after the check
[1:42 - 1:44] a trade bit and the FAQs about
[1:44 - 1:46] electricians. And here I've got party
[1:46 - 1:49] equipment higher. Again, it knows that
[1:49 - 1:51] I'm in PressWitch
[1:51 - 1:52] without me having searched for
[1:52 - 1:55] PressWitch. And this is a fresh Firefox
[1:55 - 1:58] tab with no history. And then in the
[1:58 - 2:00] places list, it's listing a load of
[2:00 - 2:03] places that are near me in PressWitch.
[2:03 - 2:04] And then we've got the organic results
[2:04 - 2:06] after that.
[2:06 - 2:08] So, we can see that it would be really
[2:08 - 2:11] good to be showing in these in this list
[2:11 - 2:13] here. And these are the Google business
[2:13 - 2:15] listings.
[2:15 - 2:16] So, to get a Google business listing is
[2:16 - 2:18] pretty straightforward. Verifying can be
[2:18 - 2:20] pretty timeconuming, but it's nothing
[2:20 - 2:23] too tricky and as long as your details
[2:23 - 2:24] are accurate, you shouldn't have any
[2:24 - 2:26] huge problems.
[2:26 - 2:28] So, to sign up for Google Business, just
[2:28 - 2:31] like any other Google product, you're
[2:31 - 2:33] going to need a Google account. You've
[2:33 - 2:34] probably got a Google account because
[2:34 - 2:37] you'll need one for YouTube, for an
[2:37 - 2:42] Android phone, for using Google Maps, or
[2:42 - 2:44] um for using any Google services.
[2:44 - 2:47] Basically, you'll need a Google account.
[2:47 - 2:49] So, if you haven't got one, you should
[2:49 - 2:51] probably get one anyway because you'll
[2:51 - 2:54] also need one for Google Search Console,
[2:54 - 2:55] which I've done a video about just
[2:55 - 2:58] recently. So, once you've got your
[2:58 - 2:59] Google account, you'll go to
[2:59 - 3:02] google.com/business.
[3:03 - 3:07] B U S I N SS. Google.com/business.
[3:07 - 3:09] And it says stand out on Google with a
[3:09 - 3:11] free business profile. And then we'll
[3:11 - 3:15] click the big get started button.
[3:15 - 3:17] Then we're going to sign in. I use a
[3:17 - 3:19] password manager, so bear with me here
[3:19 - 3:22] while I sign into my password manager.
[3:22 - 3:23] You should probably use a password
[3:23 - 3:27] manager as well, but that's too much to
[3:27 - 3:30] get into now.
[3:30 - 3:31] Okay, I'm going to sign in with my
[3:31 - 3:33] password manager.
[3:33 - 3:34] And yeah, you can see here you search
[3:34 - 3:36] for your business name and your
[3:36 - 3:38] category. So, I'm going to put some test
[3:38 - 3:42] business in info here just to test test
[3:42 - 3:46] business test category.
[3:46 - 3:48] But it wants me to select a real
[3:48 - 3:52] category. I'll put website.
[3:54 - 3:55] It'll ask me some questions here like do
[3:55 - 3:57] we have a location that people can
[3:57 - 4:01] visit? So, I'll say no.
[4:01 - 4:03] Where do we serve our customers? So here
[4:03 - 4:05] we can select your delivery areas or
[4:05 - 4:10] service areas. So I put up Manchester,
[4:10 - 4:13] UK
[4:14 - 4:17] or contact details.
[4:17 - 4:18] I won't include my contact details for
[4:18 - 4:21] now. Oh, must include a website address.
[4:21 - 4:23] Okay, so I'm going to put this example
[4:23 - 4:27] website example.tch.com.
[4:27 - 4:29] But you put your actual website address
[4:29 - 4:32] on there.
[4:35 - 4:37] And now you get through to the mailing
[4:37 - 4:39] verification bit where you'll have to
[4:39 - 4:43] put in your actual uh street address.
[4:43 - 4:44] You should continue with this. I'm going
[4:44 - 4:46] to verify later because I haven't got
[4:46 - 4:48] another street address to put in here.
[4:48 - 4:49] And what they might do after this is
[4:49 - 4:51] send you a postcard in the post to
[4:51 - 4:54] verify your address. So here it's asking
[4:54 - 4:55] me if I want to add any more services.
[4:55 - 4:57] So I can say I do software development
[4:57 - 4:59] as well.
[4:59 - 5:01] and you fill in your business hours. You
[5:01 - 5:04] should fill this in.
[5:04 - 5:08] Add a business description.
[5:08 - 5:11] This is just a test, but you should fill
[5:11 - 5:13] in at least a brief description about
[5:13 - 5:16] your business.
[5:17 - 5:20] Add photos of your business. So, here
[5:20 - 5:22] you want to at least upload a photo of
[5:22 - 5:24] your logo
[5:24 - 5:26] and hopefully a photo of some examples
[5:26 - 5:30] of the work that you've done.
[5:31 - 5:33] and then it'll warn you to sign up for
[5:33 - 5:35] Google Ads.
[5:35 - 5:37] You should skip this probably. It's a
[5:37 - 5:39] bit of a rabbit hole to go down to and
[5:39 - 5:40] immediately start making advertisements
[5:40 - 5:42] for your business.
[5:42 - 5:44] And then it'll also ask you then if you
[5:44 - 5:46] wanted create a Google Workspace
[5:46 - 5:48] account, which is Google's paid web
[5:48 - 5:52] hosting and email address system. You
[5:52 - 5:54] don't need to do this, so you can click
[5:54 - 5:57] skip.
[5:57 - 5:59] And then it'll tell me that my edit is
[5:59 - 6:00] invisible once I'm verified because it's
[6:00 - 6:03] waiting on my address to be verified,
[6:03 - 6:06] which I haven't put in. Yeah.
[6:06 - 6:08] And now that I finished, you can see
[6:08 - 6:09] it's my business is not visible to
[6:09 - 6:11] customers because it's waiting to verify
[6:11 - 6:14] my address details. If I can click this
[6:14 - 6:16] verify details, it wants me to put in a
[6:16 - 6:18] postal address. So, you'll have to go
[6:18 - 6:20] through this yourself and you'll put in
[6:20 - 6:22] an actual postal address
[6:22 - 6:26] and then it'll send you a postcard to
[6:26 - 6:29] verify that address and verify that it
[6:29 - 6:32] belongs to you.
[6:32 - 6:34] So, there's a few ways that your
[6:34 - 6:36] business can be verified. Google will
[6:36 - 6:38] use an algorithm to decide which of
[6:38 - 6:40] these ways it's going to use for your
[6:40 - 6:42] business.
[6:42 - 6:44] I would imagine that this will take into
[6:44 - 6:45] account things like company's house
[6:45 - 6:49] records or Google's existing idea of
[6:49 - 6:52] where your business is and its location.
[6:52 - 6:54] In the worst case, they can send you a
[6:54 - 6:56] postcard in the post and the postcard
[6:56 - 6:58] will contain a code that you need to
[6:58 - 7:00] enter into the Google website to verify
[7:00 - 7:03] your address, which can take a few days,
[7:03 - 7:05] but otherwise it should be just a day or
[7:05 - 7:08] two maximum to verify your business. And
[7:08 - 7:10] it might even be immediate. I'm not too
[7:10 - 7:12] experienced with the verification
[7:12 - 7:15] process to be fair.
[7:15 - 7:18] So, you've got your business verified
[7:18 - 7:20] and now it's showing up on Google.
[7:20 - 7:22] Here's what the trouble business listing
[7:22 - 7:24] looks like. I'm still fairly new as a
[7:24 - 7:26] business, so I don't have a massive
[7:26 - 7:28] remark going on here, but it's the
[7:28 - 7:30] example that I can show you. So, regard
[7:30 - 7:32] what we got. So, let's go through each
[7:32 - 7:34] of these sections in order. So, we've
[7:34 - 7:37] got edit profile where you can edit the
[7:37 - 7:39] details about your business which
[7:39 - 7:40] includes your business name, your
[7:40 - 7:43] category, your description, open date,
[7:43 - 7:45] contact details, website address, all
[7:45 - 7:47] that sort of stuff. You should fill in
[7:47 - 7:50] as much of this as you possibly can. You
[7:50 - 7:51] should especially make sure that your
[7:51 - 7:52] service areas are filled in because this
[7:52 - 7:55] tells Google directly which locations
[7:55 - 7:57] your customers are in. And if you've got
[7:57 - 7:59] opening hours that matter, then you
[7:59 - 8:00] should fill in the opening hours
[8:00 - 8:02] section, too.
[8:02 - 8:04] There's tons of details that you can
[8:04 - 8:06] fill in here that will apply to
[8:06 - 8:08] different types of businesses.
[8:08 - 8:11] For me, as a software developer at home,
[8:11 - 8:12] you know, I don't deal with people at
[8:12 - 8:15] loc at the location. So, there isn't a
[8:15 - 8:17] lot for me to fill in here. But if you
[8:17 - 8:19] ran, for example, a restaurant, there's
[8:19 - 8:21] a whole bunch of details that you could
[8:21 - 8:23] fill in about the various ways that your
[8:23 - 8:25] business operates. So, that's your
[8:25 - 8:28] business information.
[8:28 - 8:30] Next up, we've got read reviews, where
[8:30 - 8:31] you can see the reviews that people have
[8:31 - 8:34] left on your business. It can be quite
[8:34 - 8:37] nice to reply to your reviews. I don't
[8:37 - 8:38] know if I've replied to everyone here.
[8:38 - 8:40] No, I haven't. I really should get on
[8:40 - 8:41] that. Thanks for everyone who's left me
[8:41 - 8:44] a review. You should especially reply if
[8:44 - 8:47] you get a negative review and you think
[8:47 - 8:49] that it's unfounded because I think it's
[8:49 - 8:52] worth raising that in your Google
[8:52 - 8:56] business listing.
[8:56 - 8:58] Next, we've got photos, where you can
[8:58 - 9:00] upload photos that show off your
[9:00 - 9:02] business. In here, I'd make sure to
[9:02 - 9:04] upload at least your logo and a cover
[9:04 - 9:07] photo, which will show in the header box
[9:07 - 9:11] on your listing profile. And also upload
[9:11 - 9:13] some examples of work that you've done
[9:13 - 9:15] cuz that's what people who are searching
[9:15 - 9:17] for your business will be looking for.
[9:17 - 9:18] You might also want to upload a photo of
[9:18 - 9:21] yourself if you've got a smart one.
[9:21 - 9:23] photo. Listings that have got photos
[9:23 - 9:25] look better than listings that don't
[9:25 - 9:28] have photos. So, I think it's worth
[9:28 - 9:30] doing.
[9:30 - 9:32] Next, we've got performance, which tells
[9:32 - 9:34] you some details about how your business
[9:34 - 9:36] is doing on Google. For me, honestly,
[9:36 - 9:40] it's not great. 44 clicks, 39 clicks, 66
[9:40 - 9:41] clicks in January. I suppose that's
[9:41 - 9:44] better, but not a lot of clicks every
[9:44 - 9:45] month. Hopefully, yours will do better,
[9:45 - 9:48] and hopefully mine will pick up. I
[9:48 - 9:49] haven't really thought too much about
[9:49 - 9:52] advertising locally and I should really
[9:52 - 9:54] get on that. And here we show the search
[9:54 - 9:56] terms that showed up your business
[9:56 - 9:58] profile. For me, it's mostly people
[9:58 - 10:00] searching for trouble. Few people
[10:00 - 10:04] searching for web design press switch.
[10:05 - 10:07] Got how many people called me? Zero.
[10:07 - 10:09] Apparently
[10:09 - 10:11] no bookings.
[10:11 - 10:13] 167 people. It says asked for directions
[10:13 - 10:14] to my business. I'm not really sure if
[10:14 - 10:17] that makes sense because
[10:17 - 10:19] not many people would want to come visit
[10:19 - 10:22] my address for web design stuff. So, I
[10:22 - 10:24] think that might be a bit of a mistake
[10:24 - 10:27] on website clicks. Six clicks it says,
[10:27 - 10:29] which I think surely there's got to be
[10:29 - 10:30] more than that.
[10:30 - 10:33] So, who knows how accurate this data is.
[10:33 - 10:34] If it is accurate, that's a
[10:34 - 10:35] disappointing amount of website clicks
[10:35 - 10:39] for me. But there you go.
[10:39 - 10:41] Okay. Next is advertise. I won't click
[10:41 - 10:43] into that because that's Google Ads and
[10:43 - 10:49] there's a whole week's worth of lessons.
[10:50 - 10:52] Okay, next up is advertise. I won't
[10:52 - 10:53] click through into that because that's
[10:53 - 10:56] about Google Ads and there's hours that
[10:56 - 10:58] we could spend talking about Google Ads.
[10:58 - 11:00] Okay, so next up we've got edit
[11:00 - 11:03] products. In here you can list products
[11:03 - 11:05] that will appear in Google search and on
[11:05 - 11:08] maps. How these show up I'm not actually
[11:08 - 11:10] 100% sure. So, I'm going to get back to
[11:10 - 11:12] yours and let you know once I've dug
[11:12 - 11:14] into that. Next up, we've got edit
[11:14 - 11:16] services. Here, you can list the various
[11:16 - 11:18] services that your company provides. You
[11:18 - 11:19] want to make sure that everything that
[11:19 - 11:21] you do is covered in here. Google lets
[11:21 - 11:23] you add more services, and then you can
[11:23 - 11:25] add a custom service if Google isn't
[11:25 - 11:28] suggesting one that exactly matches what
[11:28 - 11:30] you're after. Next, we've got bookings.
[11:30 - 11:32] If you've got a booking system, you can
[11:32 - 11:34] add a link to it here, which will allow
[11:34 - 11:36] customers to book directly through it.
[11:36 - 11:37] You can also just link it to your
[11:37 - 11:38] contact form if you haven't got a
[11:38 - 11:41] booking system, which is what I've done.
[11:41 - 11:44] Next up, we've got the Q&A. Customers or
[11:44 - 11:46] you can ask questions of the business
[11:46 - 11:48] and then you can leave a response as the
[11:48 - 11:50] answer. Or I think visitors can even
[11:50 - 11:53] leave a response as well. So here I have
[11:53 - 11:56] asked myself what my hourly fee is and
[11:56 - 11:57] then replied to it. And then if I click
[11:57 - 12:00] through to my Google Maps listing here,
[12:00 - 12:04] we can see that the Q&A shows up in the
[12:04 - 12:06] listing itself. So, if you've got
[12:06 - 12:07] questions that you're commonly getting
[12:07 - 12:08] asked or that you think are good to tell
[12:08 - 12:10] your visitors about up front before they
[12:10 - 12:12] even click through to your website, the
[12:12 - 12:14] Q&A section is the place to do that. Add
[12:14 - 12:18] update. So, in here, we can post updates
[12:18 - 12:20] that will appear as kind of mini blog
[12:20 - 12:23] posts within Google Maps. It's hard to
[12:23 - 12:24] remember to post updates to your Google
[12:24 - 12:27] Maps listing because who's logging into
[12:27 - 12:30] Google Maps on the regular? But if you
[12:30 - 12:31] can remember when you do something
[12:31 - 12:33] substantial with your business, it would
[12:33 - 12:36] be nice to log in and go to add update
[12:36 - 12:38] here and post something about your
[12:38 - 12:40] business. So you might post about a new
[12:40 - 12:42] service that you've got or a new product
[12:42 - 12:44] that you're selling or some update to
[12:44 - 12:47] your terms and conditions or anything
[12:47 - 12:48] really. It's another little signal for
[12:48 - 12:50] any visitors who see your Google Maps
[12:50 - 12:52] listing that your business is active and
[12:52 - 12:54] up to date. I know it can feel sometimes
[12:54 - 12:56] like there's a million places to keep up
[12:56 - 12:58] to date. That kind of is. So you can add
[12:58 - 13:01] updates, offers or events. These are
[13:01 - 13:02] just different templates really for
[13:02 - 13:04] updates that appear on your Google Maps
[13:04 - 13:05] listing. And then we've got the last
[13:05 - 13:07] link, ask for reviews, which gives you a
[13:07 - 13:09] little code that you can give to someone
[13:09 - 13:10] that will immediately take them through
[13:10 - 13:12] to the place where they can leave a
[13:12 - 13:14] review for your business. Bizarrely, it
[13:14 - 13:15] lets me leave a review for my own
[13:15 - 13:18] business. Five stars. You can also share
[13:18 - 13:21] a QR code here that links people
[13:21 - 13:22] straight through to your Google Maps
[13:22 - 13:25] listing for them to leave a review. So,
[13:25 - 13:27] that's an overview of your Google
[13:27 - 13:29] business profile. I think the main
[13:29 - 13:31] things that are important here are to
[13:31 - 13:32] try and encourage some people to leave
[13:32 - 13:34] you some reviews because just one or two
[13:34 - 13:37] reviews looks a lot better than none and
[13:37 - 13:39] to make sure that your details on there
[13:39 - 13:41] are filled out as best as you're
[13:41 - 13:43] reasonably able to do. Obviously, it'll
[13:43 - 13:45] be a huge amount of work to copy all of
[13:45 - 13:47] your products onto Google Maps and to
[13:47 - 13:49] copy every single one of your images
[13:49 - 13:51] over and to keep it entirely up to date
[13:51 - 13:53] with what your website says. And I think
[13:53 - 13:54] that would probably be a bit
[13:54 - 13:56] unreasonable to do, but keeping it
[13:56 - 13:58] somewhat up to date, I think, is
[13:58 - 14:00] worthwhile. And trying to get people to
[14:00 - 14:01] leave you a review, I think, is
[14:01 - 14:03] definitely worthwhile.
[14:03 - 14:05] Speaking of which, if anyone fancies
[14:05 - 14:07] leaving me a review, I'd really
[14:07 - 14:09] appreciate it. I've only got four and
[14:09 - 14:12] it'll be nice out for a few more. So,
[14:12 - 14:14] that's Google Business. It's maybe worth
[14:14 - 14:17] me mentioning Bing Places as well, which
[14:17 - 14:20] is at bingplaces.com,
[14:20 - 14:23] which is Bing, Microsoft Search Engine,
[14:23 - 14:26] their equivalent of Google Business. You
[14:26 - 14:28] can actually import your Google Business
[14:28 - 14:30] listing straight over to Bing.
[14:30 - 14:32] Admittedly, half the anyone is searching
[14:32 - 14:35] on Bing, but some people are, so it's
[14:35 - 14:36] worth having your business show up on
[14:36 - 14:39] both.
[14:39 - 14:41] I hope that's a good overview of how
[14:41 - 14:44] Google Business works. Hopefully, it's
[14:44 - 14:46] all very straightforward. Like, Google
[14:46 - 14:47] will try and make this very easy for you
[14:47 - 14:49] to do.
[14:49 - 14:51] One question people have about Google
[14:51 - 14:53] business listings is whether they have
[14:53 - 14:55] to show their home address. You don't
[14:55 - 14:58] have to. You can set the business to say
[14:58 - 15:01] that you serve people at their address.
[15:01 - 15:05] If I go to edit profile and
[15:05 - 15:07] business address, I can untick show
[15:07 - 15:09] business address to customers and it
[15:09 - 15:12] won't show the address.
[15:12 - 15:14] But you also then won't show up in maps
[15:14 - 15:15] listing in the maps listing quite as
[15:15 - 15:19] often. So this is your call. I've taken
[15:19 - 15:20] the view that it's probably worth my
[15:20 - 15:22] address showing up for the sake of
[15:22 - 15:25] showing up a bit more often. Whether
[15:25 - 15:27] that's accurate, I don't really know.
[15:27 - 15:30] So to go over again, that website is
[15:30 - 15:33] business.google.com.
[15:33 - 15:36] Okay. As ever, I hope that was useful.
[15:36 - 15:39] If you got any questions, please let me
[15:39 - 15:41] know.
