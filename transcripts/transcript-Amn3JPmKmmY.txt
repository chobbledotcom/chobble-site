[0:03 - 0:06] Long and short tail keywords. If you're
[0:06 - 0:08] running a small to mediumsiz business in
[0:08 - 0:10] the UK, you know that it's really tough
[0:10 - 0:13] to compete with really big companies and
[0:13 - 0:16] massive marketing budgets. The resources
[0:16 - 0:18] that go into promoting a really big
[0:18 - 0:21] brand dwarf what is possible for the
[0:21 - 0:23] average small business, especially when
[0:23 - 0:25] most small businesses are trying to sort
[0:25 - 0:28] the websites themselves in amongst doing
[0:28 - 0:30] all the rest of their work. But there's
[0:30 - 0:31] a bit of a trick that you can do that
[0:31 - 0:32] levels the playing field a bit and it's
[0:32 - 0:35] about longtail keywords. Longtail
[0:35 - 0:37] keywords can help local businesses and
[0:37 - 0:39] independent businesses compete in Google
[0:39 - 0:42] and search engines for traffic. So today
[0:42 - 0:43] I'm going to break down the differences
[0:43 - 0:45] between short and longtail keywords and
[0:45 - 0:47] hopefully give you some advice about how
[0:47 - 0:50] you can use keywords on your website and
[0:50 - 0:51] attract the visitors that are searching
[0:51 - 0:53] for the services that you offer without
[0:53 - 0:55] needing to have a huge marketing budget.
[0:55 - 0:57] This might sound complicated, but it's
[0:57 - 0:59] really not. Okay, so let's get stuck in.
[0:59 - 1:02] So, first up, keywords. I've already
[1:02 - 1:03] done a post about keywords that you
[1:03 - 1:05] might want to listen to, but in summary,
[1:05 - 1:06] they're just the words that people type
[1:06 - 1:08] into Google when they're looking for
[1:08 - 1:09] something. So, first up, we've got short
[1:09 - 1:13] tail keywords. These are basic no frills
[1:13 - 1:15] search terms, one or two words. So,
[1:15 - 1:20] maybe pizza or plumber or dentist. These
[1:20 - 1:22] terms get loads of searches. Thousands
[1:22 - 1:25] of people in Manchester alone will be
[1:25 - 1:29] searching for pizza or haircut or
[1:29 - 1:32] plumber or dentist. But these search
[1:32 - 1:33] terms are also really really
[1:33 - 1:36] competitive. Like the results that show
[1:36 - 1:38] up here in the organic listings, we've
[1:38 - 1:41] got Rudy's, Pizza Hut, Chroma. Actually,
[1:41 - 1:43] it's doing local results here because it
[1:43 - 1:44] knows that I'm impressed. So, I'll
[1:44 - 1:46] search on Startpage.com, which gives me
[1:46 - 1:48] I'm going to search on Start Page here.
[1:48 - 1:50] So, I'm not getting personalized results
[1:50 - 1:51] for me because Google knows that I'm in
[1:51 - 1:53] press switch and it's going to offer me
[1:53 - 1:54] results for things that are in press
[1:54 - 1:57] switch. But start page searches Google
[1:57 - 2:00] anonymously without Google knowing
[2:00 - 2:02] specifically where you are, which gives
[2:02 - 2:04] you a better insight into what the true
[2:04 - 2:06] search results are like. So, if I search
[2:06 - 2:07] on here for pizza, we'll see that it's
[2:07 - 2:09] come up with the definition of pizza
[2:09 - 2:12] from Wikipedia. Um, some pizza place in
[2:12 - 2:14] Winsford, Pizza Hut, the Wikipedia page,
[2:14 - 2:18] Domino's Pizza Express, Rudy's, That
[2:18 - 2:21] Pizza Place, Pizza Express, Papa John's,
[2:21 - 2:23] all the big names. And even on my local
[2:23 - 2:25] search result here, it's mostly the big
[2:25 - 2:26] names that are taking up the results.
[2:26 - 2:30] There's Rudy's, Pizza Hut, Wikipedia,
[2:30 - 2:32] Domino's, Pizza Express, Trip Advisor,
[2:32 - 2:35] all big international brands that have
[2:35 - 2:38] huge marketing budgets. Now, a longtail
[2:38 - 2:40] keyword is a longer and more specific
[2:40 - 2:43] phrase. So, this might be something like
[2:43 - 2:46] vegan pizza in Manchester. These search
[2:46 - 2:48] terms don't get anywhere near as many
[2:48 - 2:50] searches as just the word pizza, but
[2:50 - 2:53] they're very specific. The people that
[2:53 - 2:54] are searching for a vegan pizza in
[2:54 - 2:56] Manchester know exactly what they want,
[2:56 - 2:58] and if that's what you offer, then
[2:58 - 3:00] you're laughing. The competition for
[3:00 - 3:02] these search terms as well is more
[3:02 - 3:04] likely to be local businesses with more
[3:04 - 3:06] reasonable marketing budgets, meaning
[3:06 - 3:08] that this search term is easier to rank
[3:08 - 3:10] for. So the results here, we've got
[3:10 - 3:13] Pureza, a pizza place in the Northern
[3:13 - 3:16] Quarter. Then we've got a vegan website
[3:16 - 3:18] talking about the best pizza places in
[3:18 - 3:20] Manchester, a couple of blogs, Pureza
[3:20 - 3:22] again, something from the University of
[3:22 - 3:24] Manchester
[3:24 - 3:26] Pro. So there is actually only a few
[3:26 - 3:27] entirely vegan pizza places in
[3:27 - 3:30] Manchester and those are all showing up.
[3:30 - 3:31] You know we've got Prove, we've got
[3:31 - 3:33] Rudes. Rudies isn't entirely vegan but
[3:33 - 3:35] they do have a lot of vegan pizzas and
[3:35 - 3:37] we've got Pureza and as far as I know
[3:37 - 3:39] those are the the vegan pizza places in
[3:39 - 3:41] Manchester. So they're all showing up on
[3:41 - 3:42] the first page here. So what we've seen
[3:42 - 3:46] here then is that by targeting a longer
[3:46 - 3:48] search term, it's easier to show up on
[3:48 - 3:50] the on the first page of Google results.
[3:50 - 3:53] Now let's talk about searcher intent.
[3:53 - 3:55] I've mentioned this in previous posts,
[3:55 - 3:56] but this is basically marketing speak
[3:56 - 3:58] for what people actually want when
[3:58 - 4:00] they're typing stuff into Google. So,
[4:00 - 4:01] there's different types of user intent.
[4:01 - 4:03] Some people are just looking for
[4:03 - 4:04] information. For example, they might be
[4:04 - 4:07] searching for what are vegan pizza
[4:07 - 4:10] toppings, or they might be searching for
[4:10 - 4:14] something specific like pureza
[4:14 - 4:17] Manchester opening times. Or they might
[4:17 - 4:19] be comparing options. So they might be
[4:19 - 4:23] saying tastiest vegan pizza in
[4:23 - 4:26] Manchester or they could be ready to
[4:26 - 4:28] spend money immediately. So they could
[4:28 - 4:32] be searching for book a table pizza
[4:32 - 4:35] Manchester. These longtail keywords can
[4:35 - 4:36] tell you quite a lot about what's going
[4:36 - 4:39] on in the searcher's head when they when
[4:39 - 4:40] they use Google. If someone just
[4:40 - 4:42] searches for pizza, it's very hard to
[4:42 - 4:44] know what they want. Do they want to
[4:44 - 4:46] learn about the history of pizza? Do
[4:46 - 4:47] they want to order a pizza? Do they just
[4:47 - 4:49] somehow not know what pizza is? There's
[4:49 - 4:50] a whole bunch of questions that they
[4:50 - 4:52] could be asking. But if someone searches
[4:52 - 4:55] for book a table pizza Manchester, you
[4:55 - 4:57] know that they're specifically looking
[4:57 - 5:00] to book a table ASAP for pizza in
[5:00 - 5:03] Manchester. For another example, let's
[5:03 - 5:05] search for solicitor. So the results
[5:05 - 5:07] that come up here cuz Google knows that
[5:07 - 5:08] I'm impressed with would just be every
[5:08 - 5:10] solicitor that's near me. Someone
[5:10 - 5:11] searching for solicitors could be
[5:11 - 5:13] searching for anything to do with
[5:13 - 5:15] needing legal help. But let's say if
[5:15 - 5:19] they search for no win no fee cycling
[5:19 - 5:22] accident solicitor in Manchester.
[5:22 - 5:24] Someone searching for this phrase has a
[5:24 - 5:27] specific problem who needs help right
[5:27 - 5:29] now and the results that come up should
[5:29 - 5:31] be more specific than just solicitor.
[5:31 - 5:32] They'll be talking about people who
[5:32 - 5:34] specifically talk about no win no fee
[5:34 - 5:36] services for cycling accident claims.
[5:36 - 5:39] I'm not sure how much I trust this AI
[5:39 - 5:40] summary at the top but a lot of people
[5:40 - 5:42] will be clicking on that in any case.
[5:42 - 5:44] So, when we're talking about searcher
[5:44 - 5:46] intent, we're talking about matching
[5:46 - 5:49] what you offer to what people are
[5:49 - 5:51] searching for. And that's how you turn
[5:51 - 5:52] someone who's just browsing the internet
[5:52 - 5:54] into a customer. So, how can we address
[5:54 - 5:57] searcher intent with longtail keywords?
[5:57 - 5:59] Well, the key really is your unique
[5:59 - 6:01] selling points. What makes your business
[6:01 - 6:03] special? What makes it different from
[6:03 - 6:05] the competition? Why should someone pick
[6:05 - 6:07] you over someone else down the road? So,
[6:07 - 6:09] first up, we've got to figure out what
[6:09 - 6:12] makes you special. Maybe you're the only
[6:12 - 6:14] bike shop in Leven that does repairs
[6:14 - 6:16] while you wait. Maybe you're a
[6:16 - 6:18] hairdresser in Pres who specializes in
[6:18 - 6:20] hair coloring. Or maybe you're a
[6:20 - 6:23] equipment supplier who uses eco-friendly
[6:23 - 6:26] materials. Or perhaps all of your
[6:26 - 6:27] ingredients are sourced locally. Or
[6:27 - 6:29] perhaps your customer service is
[6:29 - 6:31] exceptional. Or maybe you've got special
[6:31 - 6:33] qualifications that most of your
[6:33 - 6:35] competition don't have. Whatever these
[6:35 - 6:36] aspects are of your business that make
[6:36 - 6:38] them special is what you want to be
[6:38 - 6:40] thinking about in terms of longtail
[6:40 - 6:42] keywords. So, let's assume now that
[6:42 - 6:43] you've thought of a whole bunch of
[6:43 - 6:45] unique selling points about your
[6:45 - 6:46] business. How are we going to
[6:46 - 6:49] incorporate those into your website and
[6:49 - 6:51] your online presence in a way that
[6:51 - 6:53] Google will understand? So, the first
[6:53 - 6:54] thing that I would advise is if you've
[6:54 - 6:56] got a specialtity, you should probably
[6:56 - 6:58] have a whole page on your website about
[6:58 - 7:00] that. If you're a solicitor and you do
[7:00 - 7:02] you specialize in cycling accidents,
[7:02 - 7:03] it's definitely worth having a page on
[7:03 - 7:05] your site that is about cycling
[7:05 - 7:06] accidents. And we'll see here that the
[7:06 - 7:08] results that are coming up for no win no
[7:08 - 7:10] fee cycling accidents solicitor in
[7:10 - 7:13] Manchester are specifically cyclist
[7:13 - 7:16] injury pages on their site. Here's
[7:16 - 7:18] someone else cycling accidents
[7:18 - 7:21] Manchester. Here's a cycling accidents
[7:21 - 7:23] page on another site. These people have
[7:23 - 7:25] made dedicated pages about their
[7:25 - 7:28] specialtities with content on it that
[7:28 - 7:30] specifically addresses these longtail
[7:30 - 7:33] search phrases. If you wanted to target
[7:33 - 7:35] a question kind of longtail search
[7:35 - 7:40] phrase, like how much does a boiler
[7:40 - 7:42] repair cost?
[7:42 - 7:45] A good way to target this search phrase
[7:45 - 7:47] would be to have an FAQ section
[7:47 - 7:49] somewhere on your website that answered
[7:49 - 7:51] this question directly. I'd imagine if I
[7:51 - 7:54] scroll down here,
[7:54 - 7:56] you see we've got a whole bunch of
[7:56 - 7:57] results that are specifically answering
[7:57 - 7:59] questions about the cost of repairing a
[7:59 - 8:01] boilers. Another way that you might be
[8:01 - 8:03] able to squeeze a longtail search phrase
[8:03 - 8:06] onto your site is to have a case study.
[8:06 - 8:07] So, an example that I know for this is
[8:07 - 8:10] solar panel fitting press switch. The
[8:10 - 8:11] company that did our solar panels,
[8:11 - 8:14] Renegade Solar, have a page on their
[8:14 - 8:15] website that's about solar panels in
[8:15 - 8:18] BrushWitch. And there's a case study on
[8:18 - 8:21] there that's actually from me about the
[8:21 - 8:23] solar panels that Renegade fitted on my
[8:23 - 8:25] house. That's not my house. At the top
[8:25 - 8:27] here, we see we've got a press switch
[8:27 - 8:29] testimonial and we've got some words
[8:29 - 8:31] from me about the specifics of the
[8:31 - 8:33] fitting that they did on my house in
[8:33 - 8:36] Press. Another great way to get longtail
[8:36 - 8:38] search phrases onto your site is to
[8:38 - 8:40] quote some reviews on your website. If I
[8:40 - 8:42] click through to Renegade's reviews page
[8:42 - 8:44] here, we'll see that the reviews about
[8:44 - 8:47] this business are mentioning tons of
[8:47 - 8:50] longtail search phrases that are to do
[8:50 - 8:52] with specific problems that the company
[8:52 - 8:55] has solved. So, here we've got, for
[8:55 - 8:58] example, removed an EV charger
[8:58 - 9:03] or fitted a ceiling light or
[9:03 - 9:05] updated light switches and moved the
[9:05 - 9:08] ceiling light.
[9:08 - 9:11] Someone on Google might be searching for
[9:11 - 9:13] update light switches and move a ceiling
[9:13 - 9:15] light impress
[9:15 - 9:17] and renegade solar is likely to show up
[9:17 - 9:19] for that search term. Now that we've got
[9:19 - 9:21] some ideas about incorporating these
[9:21 - 9:23] longtail search phrases onto your
[9:23 - 9:25] website, what are some mistakes that you
[9:25 - 9:29] might make? Well, the first one is
[9:29 - 9:30] something that I've already mentioned
[9:30 - 9:33] before, keyword stuffing. If you're a
[9:33 - 9:35] plumber in Manchester, you don't want to
[9:35 - 9:36] write a sentence on your website that's
[9:36 - 9:39] like, "Our Manchester Plumbing,
[9:39 - 9:41] Manchester Services provide Manchester
[9:41 - 9:43] homeowners with Manchester's best
[9:43 - 9:46] Manchester plumbing." That reads really
[9:46 - 9:49] unnaturally. It's horrible to read.
[9:49 - 9:52] And Google's not dafted. Google knows
[9:52 - 9:54] that this content is being written for
[9:54 - 9:56] search engines and isn't about answering
[9:56 - 10:00] searcher intent. Google's not dafted.
[10:00 - 10:02] Another mistake that I see pretty often
[10:02 - 10:04] is people creating lots of different
[10:04 - 10:06] pages on their site that are basically
[10:06 - 10:08] targeting the same phrase. So, for
[10:08 - 10:09] example, if you're a painter and
[10:09 - 10:11] decorator and you've got a page on your
[10:11 - 10:14] site that's about house house painting
[10:14 - 10:16] in Charlton, you've got another page
[10:16 - 10:20] that's about home painting in Charlton
[10:20 - 10:22] and another one that's about residential
[10:22 - 10:25] painting in Charlton. These basically
[10:25 - 10:27] all mean the same thing. That's
[10:27 - 10:29] duplicate content. You'd be much better
[10:29 - 10:31] off having one solid page about house
[10:31 - 10:34] painting in Charlton, but happen to also
[10:34 - 10:36] mention the words home and residential
[10:36 - 10:39] and having one really good solid page
[10:39 - 10:41] rather than a whole bunch of kind of
[10:41 - 10:43] naff duplicated ones. Another mistake
[10:43 - 10:46] that I see is people using language on
[10:46 - 10:48] their site that their potential
[10:48 - 10:51] customers don't use. The common one that
[10:51 - 10:53] I see all the time is in the equipment
[10:53 - 10:55] higher space. For example, bouncy
[10:55 - 10:57] castles where people talk about bouncy
[10:57 - 11:00] castle rentals on their site, but people
[11:00 - 11:01] in the UK aren't searching for bouncy
[11:01 - 11:04] castle rental. The term rental in the UK
[11:04 - 11:07] is generally talking about your house or
[11:07 - 11:10] your home. It's not talking about hiring
[11:10 - 11:12] out a piece of equipment for a party.
[11:12 - 11:14] So, there's no point you using the word
[11:14 - 11:17] rental on your page about bouncer castle
[11:17 - 11:19] hire cuz your potential customers in the
[11:19 - 11:23] UK aren't using that phrase. So to go
[11:23 - 11:24] over what we've talked about just now,
[11:24 - 11:26] targeting longtail keywords basically
[11:26 - 11:28] means thinking about the unique selling
[11:28 - 11:30] points of your business and
[11:30 - 11:32] incorporating those onto your website.
[11:32 - 11:33] If there's no existing space where you
[11:33 - 11:35] can mention those unique selling points,
[11:35 - 11:37] then make a specific page about them.
[11:37 - 11:39] Likewise, if your about page or your
[11:39 - 11:42] homepage doesn't mention those points,
[11:42 - 11:44] try and fit them in there. I think it's
[11:44 - 11:46] quite likely really that you can
[11:46 - 11:47] probably mention all of your unique
[11:47 - 11:49] selling points on each of your product
[11:49 - 11:53] pages, category pages, or service pages
[11:53 - 11:55] because probably there's just two or
[11:55 - 11:56] three things that really set you apart
[11:56 - 11:58] from your competition. So, you want to
[11:58 - 12:00] be dragging those points home through
[12:00 - 12:02] your website
[12:02 - 12:04] to talk about Renegade Solar again
[12:04 - 12:05] because I helped them out with their
[12:05 - 12:09] website. Renegade are an MCS
[12:09 - 12:12] accredited solar panel installer. That's
[12:12 - 12:15] an accreditation that some people will
[12:15 - 12:16] specifically be searching for, but
[12:16 - 12:18] because it indicates a level of
[12:18 - 12:21] trustworthiness of the installer. So, if
[12:21 - 12:26] I search for MCS solar installer press
[12:26 - 12:27] switch, we can see that the first result
[12:27 - 12:30] is Renegade Solar in PressWitch, the
[12:30 - 12:32] website that I help out with. And
[12:32 - 12:34] someone who searches for MCS solar
[12:34 - 12:36] installer press switch is probably a
[12:36 - 12:37] more useful customer than someone who
[12:37 - 12:39] just searches for solar installer press
[12:39 - 12:41] switch. Because the person who searches
[12:41 - 12:44] for MCS is interested in the quality of
[12:44 - 12:46] the service. By targeting these longtail
[12:46 - 12:49] keywords, you can attract visitors who
[12:49 - 12:52] are searching for specific
[12:52 - 12:54] for you can attract visitors who were
[12:54 - 12:56] searching for specific aspects of your
[12:56 - 12:59] business that might justify you charging
[12:59 - 13:01] more than your competition. This kind of
[13:01 - 13:02] leads me on to something else that I was
[13:02 - 13:03] thinking that I should maybe do a
[13:03 - 13:05] Patreon video about, but I think is
[13:05 - 13:07] worth mentioning here. that it's always
[13:07 - 13:10] worth competing on quality rather than
[13:10 - 13:12] price. And longtail keywords are a
[13:12 - 13:13] really good way to do that because with
[13:13 - 13:15] longtail keywords, you're targeting
[13:15 - 13:17] savvy customers. Someone who just
[13:17 - 13:19] searches for solar installer, I would
[13:19 - 13:21] assume, knows less than someone who
[13:21 - 13:24] searches for MCS solar installer. The
[13:24 - 13:26] person who searches for MCS might know
[13:26 - 13:29] that the MCS certification is a measure
[13:29 - 13:31] of quality. And on average, I think the
[13:31 - 13:34] MCS solar installer searchers will be
[13:34 - 13:36] happier paying a higher price than just
[13:36 - 13:38] the solar installer searches. So if
[13:38 - 13:40] you've got any accreditations or any
[13:40 - 13:42] qualifications
[13:42 - 13:45] or anything else that sets you apart and
[13:45 - 13:47] can be used as a measure of quality for
[13:47 - 13:49] your business, it's definitely worth
[13:49 - 13:51] hammering that home through the content
[13:51 - 13:53] on your website. The ideal visitor to
[13:53 - 13:55] your website is someone who knows
[13:55 - 13:57] exactly what they're looking for and you
[13:57 - 13:59] provide exactly that service. and the
[13:59 - 14:02] searchers for of longtail keywords are
[14:02 - 14:04] more likely to be that kind of visitor.
[14:04 - 14:07] I hope this is making sense. I feel like
[14:07 - 14:10] I've waffled a fair bit and I hope that
[14:10 - 14:12] when I edit this together, it sounds
[14:12 - 14:14] more cohesive than it currently sounds
[14:14 - 14:17] when I'm speaking out loud. But to
[14:17 - 14:19] conclude here, make a list of the unique
[14:19 - 14:22] selling points of your business. Write
[14:22 - 14:23] content for your website that addresses
[14:23 - 14:26] those unique selling points. Make sure
[14:26 - 14:28] that savvy visitors who are looking for
[14:28 - 14:31] a high quality service are able to find
[14:31 - 14:34] you if they're searching for longtail
[14:34 - 14:37] search terms. And quality aside, make
[14:37 - 14:40] sure that your website mentions the
[14:40 - 14:42] products and services that you do. And
[14:42 - 14:44] if it's something that's of high value
[14:44 - 14:46] to you, give it. Then make sure that the
[14:46 - 14:48] page that's on your site that addresses
[14:48 - 14:50] that search term is of similarly high
[14:50 - 14:53] quality, that it addresses the phrases
[14:53 - 14:56] that searchers are using. Over and out.
[14:56 - 15:00] Thanks for listening. Chowo chia.
