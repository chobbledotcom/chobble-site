[0:03 - 0:05] Getting good at Google. In my previous
[0:05 - 0:08] post about backlinks, I mentioned some
[0:08 - 0:10] tricks that you can use for doing Google
[0:10 - 0:13] searches to find the places that mention
[0:13 - 0:15] specific domain names. You might want to
[0:15 - 0:16] do this. For example, if you're doing
[0:16 - 0:18] backlink research, if you're trying to
[0:18 - 0:20] find places on the internet where you
[0:20 - 0:21] can build back links to your own
[0:21 - 0:23] website, it could be quite useful to
[0:23 - 0:24] look at the back links that point to
[0:24 - 0:26] another website that's similar to yours
[0:26 - 0:28] and think about whether it's possible
[0:28 - 0:30] for you to get links that are somewhat
[0:30 - 0:32] similar to the website that's doing
[0:32 - 0:34] well. So, for these tests, I'm going to
[0:34 - 0:37] search for this and that, the cafe in
[0:37 - 0:40] Manchester that my friends run. It's a
[0:40 - 0:42] really delicious Indian cafe. If you're
[0:42 - 0:44] ever in Manchester in the Northern
[0:44 - 0:47] Quarter, you've got to try it. I run
[0:47 - 0:49] their website for them. So, I'm quite
[0:49 - 0:50] familiar with the search result for
[0:50 - 0:52] them. So, hopefully there won't be any
[0:52 - 0:54] crazy surprises here. So, because I'm
[0:54 - 0:57] searching for the this and that cafe
[0:57 - 0:59] website and I know their website domain,
[0:59 - 1:04] it's this and that. Cafe.co.uk.
[1:05 - 1:07] I can search for it in quotation marks
[1:07 - 1:10] like I did just then. By searching in
[1:10 - 1:11] quotation marks, it means that the
[1:11 - 1:14] results should include that phrase this
[1:14 - 1:17] and that cafe.co.uk exactly, which
[1:17 - 1:19] basically means places that are linking
[1:19 - 1:22] to the website.
[1:22 - 1:24] You can see here though that the results
[1:24 - 1:26] are largely the this and that website
[1:26 - 1:30] itself. They're all at https this and
[1:30 - 1:33] that cafe.co.uk.
[1:33 - 1:36] So, if I wanted to only include results
[1:36 - 1:38] from a website example.com, I can search
[1:38 - 1:42] for site example.com
[1:42 - 1:43] and you'll see that there's not any
[1:43 - 1:44] results here because the site
[1:44 - 1:46] example.com doesn't mention this and
[1:46 - 1:49] that cafe.co.
[1:50 - 1:53] If I want to exclude results from
[1:53 - 1:56] example.com, I can put minus site
[1:56 - 1:58] colonexample.com.
[1:58 - 1:59] And now we're back to the previous
[1:59 - 2:02] results because example.com doesn't
[2:02 - 2:04] mention this and that cafe. So excluding
[2:04 - 2:05] or including doesn't make any
[2:05 - 2:08] difference. Hope this is making sense.
[2:08 - 2:09] So now we're back to the results that
[2:09 - 2:11] include a lot of mentions of the this
[2:11 - 2:13] and that website.
[2:13 - 2:15] If I want to exclude that website, I can
[2:15 - 2:19] put minus site colon this and that
[2:19 - 2:22] cafe.co.uk.
[2:22 - 2:24] Annoyingly, when you're using these kind
[2:24 - 2:26] of fancy search phrases, Google don't
[2:26 - 2:29] explain it to you in the search results.
[2:29 - 2:31] So, you kind of have to know the tricks,
[2:31 - 2:33] but I'll put some links in the notes for
[2:33 - 2:35] this to places where you can find out
[2:35 - 2:37] other Google tricks. So, put by putting
[2:37 - 2:41] minus site this and that cafe.co.uk,
[2:41 - 2:43] I've excluded the results from this and
[2:43 - 2:45] that's own website.
[2:45 - 2:46] This means that the results that are
[2:46 - 2:49] showing now are purely the external
[2:49 - 2:52] websites that link to the this and that
[2:52 - 2:53] website.
[2:53 - 2:55] And if you have a look at these, they're
[2:55 - 2:56] kind of what you'd expect. We've got the
[2:56 - 2:58] Facebook page,
[2:58 - 3:00] best manchester restaurants.co.uk,
[3:00 - 3:02] confidentialguys.com,
[3:02 - 3:04] taste of manchester.com,
[3:04 - 3:07] yelp.com. So these are all kind of
[3:07 - 3:09] review websites or business listing
[3:09 - 3:11] websites, the kind of stuff that you
[3:11 - 3:16] would expect for a cafe.
[3:17 - 3:19] You'll see here we've also got
[3:19 - 3:22] mankusfood.wordpress.com
[3:22 - 3:23] this and that. The best lunch in
[3:23 - 3:25] Manchester. This is a blog post that
[3:25 - 3:28] someone's done about this and that.
[3:28 - 3:31] These are really valuable back links. If
[3:31 - 3:32] you've got someone who's passionate
[3:32 - 3:34] about, for example, here the Manchester
[3:34 - 3:37] food scene and then writes blog posts
[3:37 - 3:40] describing aspects of it and it includes
[3:40 - 3:42] your business, that's a really good
[3:42 - 3:45] signal to Google that your website is
[3:45 - 3:48] semantically related to the idea of the
[3:48 - 3:50] Manchester food team, for example. So if
[3:50 - 3:53] I had a cafe in Manchester and I wanted
[3:53 - 3:55] to build some backlinks towards it, I
[3:55 - 3:56] might go through these results for the
[3:56 - 3:59] this and that cafe website and make note
[3:59 - 4:01] of the kind of websites that are showing
[4:01 - 4:03] up. Some of these will be really easy
[4:03 - 4:05] for me to get myself. So for example,
[4:05 - 4:07] with Yelp.com, anyone can sign up for
[4:07 - 4:09] Yelp. It just takes a moment. Once you
[4:09 - 4:10] signed up, you'll have a listing on
[4:10 - 4:13] there. And then ideally, you want to to
[4:13 - 4:14] get like this and that. Encourage people
[4:14 - 4:17] to leave reviews on your Yelp listing
[4:17 - 4:20] page to get the stars.
[4:20 - 4:23] Other listings like the M versus food
[4:23 - 4:25] blog will be trickier for you to
[4:25 - 4:27] naturally get unless you happen to know
[4:27 - 4:30] a load of food bloggers. But if you are
[4:30 - 4:32] running a cafe for example and someone
[4:32 - 4:34] gets in touch with you who wants to
[4:34 - 4:36] write on their food blog about your
[4:36 - 4:37] cafe, you should encourage that kind of
[4:37 - 4:39] stuff. And similarly in terms of dealing
[4:39 - 4:41] with your suppliers and your customers,
[4:41 - 4:43] if someone wants to mention you on their
[4:43 - 4:45] website, then encourage that kind of
[4:45 - 4:47] behavior. You don't want to be paying
[4:47 - 4:49] each other for links. But a useful
[4:49 - 4:51] mention from someone who is passionate
[4:51 - 4:52] about the service that you provide is
[4:52 - 4:54] unbeatable. So another thing that's
[4:54 - 4:56] worth mentioning is that if you're not
[4:56 - 4:58] getting many results for the exact
[4:58 - 5:01] domain name, I can swap this out for the
[5:01 - 5:04] business name. This and that. And you'll
[5:04 - 5:06] see here then I get results and they
[5:06 - 5:08] don't necessarily have to mention the
[5:08 - 5:10] the domain name of the business, but
[5:10 - 5:15] they're still about the cafe.
[5:17 - 5:19] Now, I'm kind of surprised that there's
[5:19 - 5:21] only results about the cafe showing up
[5:21 - 5:22] because this and that you would think is
[5:22 - 5:25] a relatively common phrase, but I
[5:25 - 5:27] suppose Google knows that I'm in
[5:27 - 5:29] Manchester.
[5:29 - 5:31] If I wanted to get results that weren't
[5:31 - 5:33] personalized to Manchester, I could go
[5:33 - 5:35] to startpage.com
[5:35 - 5:39] s a r p a ge.com.
[5:39 - 5:42] And this search is Google but through a
[5:42 - 5:44] proxy which means that Google don't know
[5:44 - 5:46] that I'm in Manchester. So let's see if
[5:46 - 5:49] I put here this and that. I'll do the
[5:49 - 5:52] same thing. Minus site this and that.
[5:52 - 5:55] Cafe.co.uk.
[5:55 - 5:58] So when I search on star page I get the
[5:58 - 6:00] same results for the first page
[6:00 - 6:02] cuz I suppose this and that is probably
[6:02 - 6:04] the most famous this and that in the
[6:04 - 6:05] world.
[6:05 - 6:07] But then on the third page, we're
[6:07 - 6:10] getting results for this and that, an
[6:10 - 6:13] animation song for children,
[6:13 - 6:16] this and that, K9 Co. that does treats
[6:16 - 6:19] and chews for pets. So if I wanted to
[6:19 - 6:22] exclude those kind of results, I might
[6:22 - 6:24] narrow this down by doing this and that
[6:24 - 6:27] and then also Manchester and boos. This
[6:27 - 6:29] is only going to include results now
[6:29 - 6:32] that include the phrase this and that
[6:32 - 6:34] and also the phrase Manchester which is
[6:34 - 6:36] only going to be results about the curry
[6:36 - 6:38] house. And you can see here I'm clicking
[6:38 - 6:40] through multiple pages and it's all
[6:40 - 6:44] stuff about the curry place.
[6:51 - 6:53] So, if you're wondering what kind of
[6:53 - 6:55] links are pointing to your competition
[6:55 - 6:56] or the websites that are doing well in
[6:56 - 6:58] your arena, or you're just curious about
[6:58 - 7:00] what kind of backlinks it's possible to
[7:00 - 7:02] have, then this can be a really good way
[7:02 - 7:04] to do it by searching for the business
[7:04 - 7:08] name in quotation marks, maybe narrowing
[7:08 - 7:12] it down to a city in quotation marks
[7:12 - 7:14] if you're getting lots of results for
[7:14 - 7:16] just a business name, and then excluding
[7:16 - 7:19] the results from the website itself by
[7:19 - 7:23] using minus site colon and then the site
[7:23 - 7:25] then the site's domain name. Another
[7:25 - 7:26] trick another trick that's worth showing
[7:26 - 7:28] you I suppose while I'm on here is if I
[7:28 - 7:30] wanted to see all of the results from
[7:30 - 7:32] the website this and that cafe I can
[7:32 - 7:35] strip this down to just site colon this
[7:35 - 7:37] and that cafe.co.
[7:37 - 7:39] This will only include results from the
[7:39 - 7:42] website this and that cafe.co.uk. So
[7:42 - 7:44] I'll search here and now you'll see all
[7:44 - 7:46] of the results are from this and that
[7:46 - 7:49] cafe.co.uk.
[7:49 - 7:50] So if you were curious about the places
[7:50 - 7:52] on a website that mention for example
[7:52 - 7:55] I'll search for the word vegan here.
[7:55 - 7:57] I can search for site this and that
[7:57 - 7:59] cafe.co.uk
[7:59 - 8:02] then vegan and it will tell me each of
[8:02 - 8:05] the pages on the this and that page that
[8:05 - 8:08] mention the word vegan.
[8:08 - 8:10] This can be a really good way to dig
[8:10 - 8:13] through a really large website to find
[8:13 - 8:14] the specific information that you're
[8:14 - 8:16] after. It can also be a good way to find
[8:16 - 8:18] out which pages of yours Google has
[8:18 - 8:21] indexed. If you search for site your
[8:21 - 8:24] domain name and then you find out that
[8:24 - 8:27] important pages aren't showing up.
[8:27 - 8:28] there's probably something wrong there.
[8:28 - 8:30] And you should log into Google Search
[8:30 - 8:34] Console. See my other video about that.
[8:34 - 8:35] And see if there's any messages showing
[8:35 - 8:38] up or any warnings because every page on
[8:38 - 8:40] your website in theory ought to be
[8:40 - 8:42] indexed and showing in Google's search
[8:42 - 8:46] results if you use site dot dot.
[8:46 - 8:48] This can get a bit tricky if you've got
[8:48 - 8:49] thousands and thousands of pages on your
[8:49 - 8:52] site, but for most small business
[8:52 - 8:54] websites, it should be pretty easy to
[8:54 - 8:55] scan through the results and make sure
[8:55 - 8:57] they all make sense.
[8:57 - 8:59] All right, as ever, I hope that was
[8:59 - 9:01] useful. If you got any questions or any
[9:01 - 9:03] ideas for future videos or any comments
[9:03 - 9:06] at all, I'd really appreciate the
[9:06 - 9:11] feedback and I'll see you next time.
