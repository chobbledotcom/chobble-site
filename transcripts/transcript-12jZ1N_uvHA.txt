[0:03 - 0:06] targeting local areas part two. I
[0:06 - 0:08] recently relisted to my first post on
[0:08 - 0:10] this Patreon channel about targeting
[0:10 - 0:12] local areas and I thought that what
[0:12 - 0:14] could be quite useful would be to run
[0:14 - 0:16] through an example of this for a
[0:16 - 0:18] fictional real life business and I can
[0:18 - 0:20] show you what the process would be like
[0:20 - 0:22] to create these locationbased service
[0:22 - 0:25] pages on your website. So, let's imagine
[0:25 - 0:28] that we're starting a fitness studio in
[0:28 - 0:31] Preswitch, which is where I live, and we
[0:31 - 0:33] want to create pages on our website that
[0:33 - 0:36] are for other search terms, for nearby
[0:36 - 0:38] towns, cuz really, we want people from
[0:38 - 0:41] Whitefield or Radcliffe or, you know,
[0:41 - 0:42] any of the other places that are near me
[0:42 - 0:44] in North Manchester to also know about
[0:44 - 0:46] this fitness studio because they could
[0:46 - 0:47] be a customer just as easily as someone
[0:47 - 0:49] from Breast could be. This also applies
[0:49 - 0:51] if you're based in an area and you visit
[0:51 - 0:53] people at their address. You probably
[0:53 - 0:55] want people from the areas that you
[0:55 - 0:57] operate in to find your website even
[0:57 - 1:00] though you're not in their exact town.
[1:00 - 1:02] So here we're going to create a service
[1:02 - 1:04] page for my fitness classes in
[1:04 - 1:05] Whitefield. So you can see here on the
[1:05 - 1:07] right side of the page, I've created a
[1:07 - 1:08] bunch of questions that I think you
[1:08 - 1:10] could probably ask very similar
[1:10 - 1:11] questions about for the service areas
[1:11 - 1:14] that you target. So to run through them
[1:14 - 1:15] very quickly, we've got how will
[1:15 - 1:17] residents get to my business? What local
[1:17 - 1:19] businesses are similar to mine? What
[1:19 - 1:21] makes my business different from them?
[1:21 - 1:22] Do I have any testimonials from this
[1:22 - 1:24] area? Do I contribute to the community
[1:24 - 1:26] in this area? Do the demographics of
[1:26 - 1:28] this area affect my work there? Which
[1:28 - 1:31] venues in this area have I worked with?
[1:31 - 1:32] What's the logistical quirks of working
[1:32 - 1:35] in this area? And how long have I been
[1:35 - 1:37] working in this area? And I think just
[1:37 - 1:38] filling out this kind of information,
[1:38 - 1:40] and I'm just going to do it in bullet
[1:40 - 1:42] points here, is a pretty good start for
[1:42 - 1:45] creating these service-based pages. So,
[1:45 - 1:47] first off, we've got how will residents
[1:47 - 1:48] get to my business? Well, I don't need
[1:48 - 1:50] to do much Googling for this. Whitefield
[1:50 - 1:51] is only around the corner. So they could
[1:51 - 1:54] either travel one or two stops on the
[1:54 - 1:56] metro link. They could get a bus that
[1:56 - 1:58] goes down very old or new road. They
[1:58 - 2:01] could drive. It's only ever going to be
[2:01 - 2:03] a maximum 10 minutes from anywhere in
[2:03 - 2:05] Whitefield to anywhere in Pres. Or they
[2:05 - 2:06] could walk. Walking from Whitefield to
[2:06 - 2:09] Preswitch probably only takes 25 to 40
[2:09 - 2:11] minutes depending on whereabouts you
[2:11 - 2:13] are. So what local businesses are
[2:13 - 2:15] similar to mine? So I don't know much
[2:15 - 2:17] about the fitness scene in Whitefield.
[2:17 - 2:19] So let's have a search here. fitness
[2:19 - 2:22] classes, Whitefield. So, we can see
[2:22 - 2:25] we've got a few gyms, the women's gym,
[2:25 - 2:28] gym phobics. There's some big brand name
[2:28 - 2:30] gyms that'll do organized classes like
[2:30 - 2:32] Total Fitness and the Gym Group and
[2:32 - 2:35] Whitefield Palatees. So, we've got here,
[2:35 - 2:38] let's make some notes. We've got Women's
[2:38 - 2:42] Gym, Total Fitness, and the Gym Group.
[2:42 - 2:44] And we've also got Gymophobics.
[2:44 - 2:46] What makes my business different from
[2:46 - 2:47] theirs? Let's imagine that I'm creating
[2:47 - 2:50] a website here for beginners to fitness
[2:50 - 2:53] that's for all genders. So unlike Total
[2:53 - 2:55] Fitness or the Gym Group, mine's going
[2:55 - 2:57] to be a small business where you'll get
[2:57 - 3:00] personal advice. My fitness classes are
[3:00 - 3:02] going to be for beginners. So we'll say
[3:02 - 3:04] that it's for for beginners. It's going
[3:04 - 3:06] to be slightly more expensive than the
[3:06 - 3:08] the gym group, but slightly less
[3:08 - 3:10] expensive than Total Fitness. We can say
[3:10 - 3:11] that it's going to be cheaper than the
[3:11 - 3:13] expensive gym. And let's also say that
[3:13 - 3:16] we're open in the evenings because I
[3:16 - 3:17] know that that's a problem with some
[3:17 - 3:19] smaller gyms. So, next question. Do I
[3:19 - 3:21] have any testimonials from this area?
[3:21 - 3:23] So, let's say that I've been collecting
[3:23 - 3:25] reviews on my Google Maps listing or on
[3:25 - 3:27] Trust Pilot or on Facebook. It might be
[3:27 - 3:29] worth having a bit of a look through and
[3:29 - 3:30] see if there's any testimonials or any
[3:30 - 3:34] reviews that mention Whitefield.
[3:34 - 3:35] It's quite likely that you will have
[3:35 - 3:37] some that mention different towns. They
[3:37 - 3:38] might have compared you to a service
[3:38 - 3:40] from their town. They might talk about
[3:40 - 3:41] how they couldn't find what they were
[3:41 - 3:43] looking for in their town. So, let's say
[3:43 - 3:44] here that we found a few testimonials.
[3:44 - 3:46] We found one from Emma who talks about
[3:46 - 3:48] how we're friendlier than the big gyms.
[3:48 - 3:49] Then, let's say we've got one from
[3:49 - 3:51] Stuart who says he's rides his bike down
[3:51 - 3:53] from Whitefield and parks it in our bike
[3:53 - 3:55] lock outside. And then, let's say we've
[3:55 - 3:56] got one from Stefan who is a total
[3:56 - 3:58] beginner and doesn't mention anything
[3:58 - 3:59] about Whitefield, but it's nice to have
[3:59 - 4:00] a testimonial on the page from him
[4:00 - 4:02] anyway. So, you'll see here what I'm
[4:02 - 4:04] getting at. We're creating a bit of a
[4:04 - 4:06] list here of things that sell this
[4:06 - 4:08] business to a potential customer from
[4:08 - 4:10] Whitefield. So, let's continue a bit
[4:10 - 4:11] here. So, next up, we've got, do I
[4:11 - 4:13] contribute to the community in this
[4:13 - 4:15] area? Let's say that this gym organizes
[4:15 - 4:17] runs around Spring Water Park in
[4:17 - 4:19] Whitefield. Next up, we've got, do the
[4:19 - 4:21] demographics of this area affect my work
[4:21 - 4:23] there? Well, Whitefield, like Press
[4:23 - 4:25] Switch, is largely a commuter town, and
[4:25 - 4:27] a lot of people will be traveling to
[4:27 - 4:30] Manchester or to Bur to do their jobs.
[4:30 - 4:32] And so it's quite likely that they'll be
[4:32 - 4:34] wanting to pop into a gym on the way
[4:34 - 4:35] back from their job, which is perfect
[4:35 - 4:37] for anyone who lives in Whitefield and
[4:37 - 4:38] travels to Manchester because they'll be
[4:38 - 4:40] passing through Press Rich on their way.
[4:40 - 4:42] So I can say, yeah, it does affect it
[4:42 - 4:44] that if you're commuting to Manchester,
[4:44 - 4:46] you can stop in on the on your way home
[4:46 - 4:48] cuz we're open in the evenings. So which
[4:48 - 4:50] venues have I worked with this in this
[4:50 - 4:51] area? Well, we've already got the Spring
[4:51 - 4:53] Water Park and that might be enough.
[4:53 - 4:55] What are the logistical quirks of
[4:55 - 4:56] working in this area? Well, one thing
[4:56 - 4:58] that could be bad between Press Rich and
[4:58 - 4:59] Whitefield, even though we're only right
[4:59 - 5:01] next to each other, the traffic at rush
[5:01 - 5:03] hour on the main motorway junction
[5:03 - 5:04] between the two towns can make traveling
[5:04 - 5:06] between them surprisingly slow. So, we
[5:06 - 5:08] might want to say that you might want to
[5:08 - 5:10] stagger your visit so it doesn't collide
[5:10 - 5:13] with rush hour. Rush hour traffic can be
[5:13 - 5:15] bad. And how long have I been working in
[5:15 - 5:17] this area? Well, this doesn't really
[5:17 - 5:18] apply to a fitness class, but we can say
[5:18 - 5:20] the total time that the fitness class
[5:20 - 5:21] has been running. So, let's say it's
[5:21 - 5:23] been going for 3 years. So now you'll
[5:23 - 5:25] see we've got a pretty good file that
[5:25 - 5:26] describes quite a lot about this
[5:26 - 5:28] business and it's specifics to
[5:28 - 5:30] Whitefield which might seem like a
[5:30 - 5:32] strange thing to talk about for a
[5:32 - 5:33] fitness class that's in Pressure Witch a
[5:33 - 5:35] different town but you'll see really
[5:35 - 5:36] there's quite a few things we thought of
[5:36 - 5:38] even for this kind of strange contrived
[5:38 - 5:40] example. So now what I'm going to do and
[5:40 - 5:43] I don't advise this but I know how
[5:43 - 5:44] people are and I know that people like
[5:44 - 5:47] to take shortcuts so it's worth talking
[5:47 - 5:49] about. I'm going to feed this to AI and
[5:49 - 5:51] I'm going to ask it to generate the
[5:51 - 5:53] framework of a page for me. So I've
[5:53 - 5:55] opened a chat here on the left hand side
[5:55 - 5:58] to my favorite AI model at the minute,
[5:58 - 6:00] Claude Sonet 4, but really any will do.
[6:00 - 6:02] The important thing to remember here is
[6:02 - 6:03] we're using this to give us a framework
[6:03 - 6:06] for the page and not so much to write
[6:06 - 6:07] every single word of it. It should still
[6:07 - 6:09] be in your voice. So I'm going to prompt
[6:09 - 6:11] the AI with exactly what I'm doing. and
[6:11 - 6:13] I'll say I'm writing a page on my
[6:13 - 6:15] website for fitness classes in
[6:15 - 6:17] PressWitch trying to target potential
[6:17 - 6:20] site visitors in my field. The fitness
[6:20 - 6:25] class is open late on weekdays and
[6:25 - 6:29] caters to total beginners. I'm going to
[6:29 - 6:34] paste a bunch of notes about my business
[6:34 - 6:37] and Whitefield and I want you to give me
[6:37 - 6:42] the outline of a page for my website
[6:42 - 6:46] targeting Whitefield visitors. Write in
[6:46 - 6:49] concise, slightly informal British
[6:49 - 6:51] English. And then I'm going to paste the
[6:51 - 6:53] whole text that I've just copied from my
[6:53 - 6:55] document on the right and let's see what
[6:55 - 6:58] it gives us. Okay, so you see it's given
[6:58 - 6:59] us quite a short layout of what this
[6:59 - 7:01] page could look like. Fitness classes
[7:01 - 7:03] for impress for Whitefield residents.
[7:03 - 7:05] It's an easy journey from Whitefield.
[7:05 - 7:06] Get into our classes couldn't be
[7:06 - 7:07] simpler. Hop on the Metro Link for just
[7:07 - 7:09] one or two stops. Catch a bus down very
[7:09 - 7:11] old or new road or it's a quick
[7:11 - 7:13] 10-minute drive max. Perfect for popping
[7:13 - 7:14] in on your way home from work in
[7:14 - 7:16] Manchester. Why choose us over the big
[7:16 - 7:17] gyms? We know Whitefield has plenty of
[7:17 - 7:19] options like Total Fitness in the Gym
[7:19 - 7:20] Group. But here's what makes us
[7:20 - 7:21] different. Proper personal attention.
[7:21 - 7:22] We're a small business that actually
[7:22 - 7:24] gets to know you. Total beginner
[7:24 - 7:26] friendly. No intimidating muscle heads
[7:26 - 7:28] or complicated equipment. Evening
[7:28 - 7:30] classes that work around your commute.
[7:30 - 7:31] Better value than those pricey gym
[7:31 - 7:34] memberships. What Whitefield locals say.
[7:34 - 7:36] And then it's got some madeup quotes
[7:36 - 7:38] that we would want to fix with actual
[7:38 - 7:40] real testimonials. And then we've got
[7:40 - 7:42] part of your community and a bit of bump
[7:42 - 7:44] about how we've been welcoming
[7:44 - 7:45] Whitefield residents for three years now
[7:45 - 7:46] and we even support the spring water
[7:46 - 7:48] park runs. Whether you're cycling over
[7:48 - 7:50] like Stewart or just or you just want
[7:50 - 7:51] somewhere that feels more personal than
[7:51 - 7:53] the chain gyms, we're here for you.
[7:53 - 7:55] Ready to give it a go? book your
[7:55 - 7:57] beginner friendly class today. Now, I
[7:57 - 7:58] would say that this content isn't very
[7:58 - 8:01] good still, but it's a good basis for
[8:01 - 8:03] the page. The things that I think are
[8:03 - 8:05] missing from it are I think the wording
[8:05 - 8:08] still sounds quite AI in that it's kind
[8:08 - 8:10] of doesn't it doesn't sound particularly
[8:10 - 8:12] Manchestery and I think some of the
[8:12 - 8:14] wording is a bit strange like
[8:14 - 8:15] intimidating muscle heads. I don't know
[8:15 - 8:17] if I would put that on a page about my
[8:17 - 8:19] gym. I think I'd probably as well make
[8:19 - 8:21] sure that I had a better call to action.
[8:21 - 8:23] So, I would say, "Please call us or fill
[8:23 - 8:25] in the contact form or drop us an
[8:25 - 8:27] email." Make it really obvious what you
[8:27 - 8:30] want the next step to be. I would also
[8:30 - 8:31] probably go into some detail about
[8:31 - 8:33] pricing and answer some specific
[8:33 - 8:35] questions that people might have. So, I
[8:35 - 8:37] might mention on here the types of
[8:37 - 8:38] equipment that we've got, how much it
[8:38 - 8:41] costs, what kind of offers we have.
[8:41 - 8:42] Basically, I'm making a landing page
[8:42 - 8:44] that someone can land on as an
[8:44 - 8:46] alternative to my homepage that contains
[8:46 - 8:48] everything that they need to know about
[8:48 - 8:50] my business tailored specifically for
[8:50 - 8:53] them being from Whitefield. So, I hope
[8:53 - 8:55] this has been useful. I think by
[8:55 - 8:57] following a plan like this, you can
[8:57 - 8:58] probably create a page for a town near
[8:58 - 9:00] you in probably just an hour or two and
[9:00 - 9:02] then that page will live forever on your
[9:02 - 9:04] website, attracting visitors from that
[9:04 - 9:06] town. So the work that you put in here
[9:06 - 9:08] now in terms of thinking about how your
[9:08 - 9:10] business can appeal to people from
[9:10 - 9:12] nearby towns and what specific aspects
[9:12 - 9:14] of being in that town apply to your
[9:14 - 9:17] business pays off forever and ever and
[9:17 - 9:19] ever because that Google will index that
[9:19 - 9:23] page and it will always show. So don't
[9:23 - 9:25] feel like you have to get 10 pages
[9:25 - 9:28] knocked out today. Don't feel tempted to
[9:28 - 9:30] copy and paste them because as we've
[9:30 - 9:31] seen there's quite a lot of specific
[9:31 - 9:32] stuff about Whitefield in here. You
[9:32 - 9:34] couldn't just copy this and change the
[9:34 - 9:36] word Whitefield to Radcliffe. And that's
[9:36 - 9:38] a good thing because you want this page
[9:38 - 9:40] to be very specific to fitness classes
[9:40 - 9:42] in Preswitch for Whitefield residents.
[9:42 - 9:44] So, take your time building up these
[9:44 - 9:46] pages. Really think about the specifics.
[9:46 - 9:48] I'm going to paste these questions that
[9:48 - 9:49] I've asked into the notes for this
[9:49 - 9:51] Patreon post so you can copy them and
[9:51 - 9:53] fill out a page just like I've done
[9:53 - 9:54] here. And I hope this gives you some
[9:54 - 9:56] good inspiration for creating these
[9:56 - 9:57] pages on your site that target specific
[9:57 - 9:59] service areas because I've seen them
[9:59 - 10:01] work really, really well. I've even seen
[10:01 - 10:03] them work okay on people who just copy
[10:03 - 10:06] and paste the same waffle over and over,
[10:06 - 10:08] but I've seen them work exceptionally
[10:08 - 10:10] well on websites that put a bit of
[10:10 - 10:12] effort into thinking about what are the
[10:12 - 10:14] specific nuances of delivering that
[10:14 - 10:17] service in that area. Okay, as always, I
[10:17 - 10:18] hope this has been useful. Any
[10:18 - 10:20] questions, please leave me a comment or
[10:20 - 10:21] if you've got any ideas for future
[10:21 - 10:25] posts, as ever, I'm all ears. All right,
[10:25 - 10:28] take care.
