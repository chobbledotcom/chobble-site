[0:03 - 0:05] keywords. So, I already did a post on
[0:05 - 0:07] keywords and I've done a whole bunch of
[0:07 - 0:09] posts where I kind of mention keywords,
[0:09 - 0:12] but the first post was just a PDF and
[0:12 - 0:14] reading back over it, I think it could
[0:14 - 0:17] do with a video. So, what is a keyword?
[0:17 - 0:18] Forgive me if any of this sounds really
[0:18 - 0:21] obvious, but a keyword is basically a
[0:21 - 0:24] string of words that a person might type
[0:24 - 0:26] into a search engine. So, for example,
[0:26 - 0:27] I'm looking at Google and let's say I
[0:27 - 0:30] look for pizza. The results that come up
[0:30 - 0:33] are about the search term pizza. Pizza
[0:33 - 0:34] is the keyword. And why is Google
[0:34 - 0:36] showing these results? Because Google
[0:36 - 0:38] has analyzed those websites and thinks
[0:38 - 0:40] that they're relevant to the search term
[0:40 - 0:42] pizza. Let's see what the results are.
[0:42 - 0:44] We've got a bunch of pizza places near
[0:44 - 0:47] me in PressWitch because Google knows
[0:47 - 0:49] that I'm in PressWitch. We can see here
[0:49 - 0:50] it says results for PressWitch
[0:50 - 0:52] Manchester. Google knows my IP address.
[0:52 - 0:55] I'm also logged in so they know where I
[0:55 - 0:56] am. And the results that it's showing
[0:56 - 0:59] are, as you would expect, pizza
[0:59 - 1:01] websites.
[1:01 - 1:03] Trip Advisor talking about pizza places
[1:03 - 1:05] in PressWitch. Wikipedia talking about
[1:05 - 1:08] pizza. Domino's Pizza Express.
[1:08 - 1:11] So that's a keyword. Now, the search
[1:11 - 1:14] term pizza here is quite vague. Is the
[1:14 - 1:17] person looking to buy pizza? Do they
[1:17 - 1:18] want to learn about pizza? I've kind of
[1:18 - 1:21] mentioned this before. So, there's a few
[1:21 - 1:22] different intentions that a person might
[1:22 - 1:25] have here. They might search for how to
[1:25 - 1:28] make pizza.
[1:28 - 1:29] And if they search for how to make
[1:29 - 1:31] pizza, you can be pretty sure that this
[1:31 - 1:33] person isn't going to buy anything.
[1:33 - 1:36] They're looking for instructions.
[1:36 - 1:38] They're not looking to make a sale. But
[1:38 - 1:42] if they search for pizza in PressWitch,
[1:42 - 1:43] you can be pretty sure here that this is
[1:43 - 1:45] someone who's going to buy something
[1:45 - 1:46] because they're searching for pizza near
[1:46 - 1:48] them. That's a pretty strange thing to
[1:48 - 1:51] do. unless the context of what you're
[1:51 - 1:53] searching for is that you'd like a pizza
[1:53 - 1:55] to be delivered to your house. And as
[1:55 - 1:57] you'd expect, the results are pizza
[1:57 - 1:59] places near me. Whereas, when I searched
[1:59 - 2:01] for how to make pizza, the results
[2:01 - 2:03] weren't anything to do with PressWitch.
[2:03 - 2:04] These are just from the cold internet
[2:04 - 2:07] because Google knows that these aren't
[2:07 - 2:09] local search terms that PressWitch is
[2:09 - 2:12] particularly relevant for. So, how does
[2:12 - 2:15] Google decide that these results should
[2:15 - 2:17] show up for how to make pizza? Well,
[2:17 - 2:18] this is getting into some really
[2:18 - 2:21] complicated kind of computer science,
[2:21 - 2:24] but a very kind of broad overview would
[2:24 - 2:26] be that Google has got a really clever
[2:26 - 2:28] system that's able to categorize
[2:28 - 2:30] websites in a way that doesn't
[2:30 - 2:32] necessarily have to specifically line up
[2:32 - 2:34] with the search terms that someone used.
[2:34 - 2:36] So, here when I've searched for how to
[2:36 - 2:38] make pizza, this first result here,
[2:38 - 2:39] homemade pizza and pizza dough recipe,
[2:39 - 2:41] if I click through, it doesn't actually
[2:41 - 2:43] say the phrase how to make pizza on
[2:43 - 2:48] here. If I search how to make pizza, you
[2:48 - 2:49] see it's gone red. It doesn't match any
[2:49 - 2:51] results.
[2:51 - 2:52] But Google knows that when you're
[2:52 - 2:54] searching for how to make something and
[2:54 - 2:57] if that thing is a food, then recipes
[2:57 - 2:58] are the kind of results that you're
[2:58 - 3:00] looking for. And so it shows the page
[3:00 - 3:03] which is relevant for a recipe. This is
[3:03 - 3:05] simply recipes.com. It's all about
[3:05 - 3:07] recipes. So we can see there that even
[3:07 - 3:09] with this quite simple example, how to
[3:09 - 3:11] make pizza. The first result, and
[3:11 - 3:13] that'll be a really competitive search
[3:13 - 3:15] term, doesn't say the phrase how to make
[3:15 - 3:18] pizza on it. It instead is a page that
[3:18 - 3:20] is about how to make pizza. And Google
[3:20 - 3:22] is clever enough to know that a page
[3:22 - 3:24] that's about how to make pizza is the
[3:24 - 3:25] kind of thing that should show when
[3:25 - 3:28] someone searches for how to make pizza.
[3:28 - 3:29] I'm saying the phrase how to make pizza
[3:29 - 3:32] an awful lot here. How to make pizza.
[3:32 - 3:34] How to make pizza. How to make pizza.
[3:34 - 3:37] I'll say it a few more times.
[3:37 - 3:38] But we can see here that the third
[3:38 - 3:41] result here does say learn how to make
[3:41 - 3:43] homemade pizza. So it kind of partially
[3:43 - 3:45] matches the search term exactly. But
[3:45 - 3:48] anyway, so how does this relate to your
[3:48 - 3:50] business? Well, I suppose what it means
[3:50 - 3:52] is that Google's quite clever. So if
[3:52 - 3:54] your business is doing pizza in
[3:54 - 3:56] PressWitch, then what your website needs
[3:56 - 3:58] to do is make sure that it's really
[3:58 - 4:00] clear that you sell pizza and that
[4:00 - 4:02] you're in PressWitch. It doesn't
[4:02 - 4:04] necessarily need to say the phrase pizza
[4:04 - 4:06] in PressWitch. And if it feels awkward
[4:06 - 4:08] to say that on your website, which it
[4:08 - 4:09] might do, that's kind of a strange thing
[4:09 - 4:11] to say, pizza impressed as a page title
[4:11 - 4:13] or whatever, you might want your tagline
[4:13 - 4:16] to be a bit more creative than pizza
[4:16 - 4:18] impressed witch. So, you shouldn't feel
[4:18 - 4:20] any great pressure to squeeze the phrase
[4:20 - 4:23] pizza in press into your site. Instead,
[4:23 - 4:24] you should just, like I said, make it
[4:24 - 4:26] clear that that's what you do. If you
[4:26 - 4:29] did decide, despite my advice, that you
[4:29 - 4:31] wanted to try and fit every single
[4:31 - 4:33] keyword phrase that someone might use
[4:33 - 4:36] into your website for the pizza example,
[4:36 - 4:38] that might mean that your website says
[4:38 - 4:41] pizza impress, margarita impress,
[4:41 - 4:43] Hawaiian pizza impress, barbecue pizza
[4:43 - 4:46] impress, and so on and so on and so on,
[4:46 - 4:48] which I think would result in your the
[4:48 - 4:50] content on your site reading quite
[4:50 - 4:52] horribly. Whereas instead, if you just
[4:52 - 4:54] list the types of pizzas that you do on
[4:54 - 4:56] a menu page, for example, and you
[4:56 - 4:58] describe that you're impressed with on
[4:58 - 5:00] your contact page and on the text that's
[5:00 - 5:01] on the other pages, Google will
[5:01 - 5:02] understand that you're a pizzeria you're
[5:02 - 5:04] impressed with. And if you need any more
[5:04 - 5:06] persuading that you should try and write
[5:06 - 5:08] naturally rather than squeezing lots of
[5:08 - 5:11] keywords in. Here's the spam policies
[5:11 - 5:13] page for Google on their documentation.
[5:13 - 5:15] And if I scroll down a bit, you'll see
[5:15 - 5:16] that they've got a section all about
[5:16 - 5:18] keyword stuffing where they say, and let
[5:18 - 5:20] me zoom in. Keyword stuffing refers to
[5:20 - 5:22] the practice of filling a web page with
[5:22 - 5:24] keywords or numbers in an attempt to
[5:24 - 5:26] manipulate rankings in Google search
[5:26 - 5:28] results. Often these keywords appear in
[5:28 - 5:30] a list or group unnaturally or out of
[5:30 - 5:32] context. Examples of keyword stuffing
[5:32 - 5:33] include list of phone numbers without
[5:33 - 5:36] substantial added value, blocks of text
[5:36 - 5:38] that list citizen regions that a website
[5:38 - 5:40] is trying to rank for, and repeating the
[5:40 - 5:41] same words and phrases so often that it
[5:41 - 5:44] sounds unnatural. For example, and then
[5:44 - 5:46] they give this example. Try and think if
[5:46 - 5:48] this reads like your website content.
[5:48 - 5:51] And if it does, then bear in mind that
[5:51 - 5:53] you're doing exactly what Google say not
[5:53 - 5:56] to do. Their example says unlimited app
[5:56 - 5:57] store credit. There are so many sites
[5:57 - 5:59] that claim to offer app store credit for
[5:59 - 6:01] 0, but they're all fake and always mess
[6:01 - 6:02] up with users looking for unlimited app
[6:02 - 6:04] store credits. You can get limitless
[6:04 - 6:06] credits for app store here on the
[6:06 - 6:09] website. Visit our unlimited app store
[6:09 - 6:11] credit page and get it today. You'll see
[6:11 - 6:12] that in the example that Google have
[6:12 - 6:15] provided here about keyword stuffing.
[6:15 - 6:17] It's not that bad. Like I see worse
[6:17 - 6:20] websites all the time that have way more
[6:20 - 6:22] keywords squeezed in way more
[6:22 - 6:24] unnaturally than the example that Google
[6:24 - 6:26] give. Another thing that I see all the
[6:26 - 6:28] time is the second point, blocks of text
[6:28 - 6:30] that list cities and regions that a web
[6:30 - 6:33] page is trying to rank for. I see this
[6:33 - 6:35] all the time on people's websites. So
[6:35 - 6:37] you want to be trying to write naturally
[6:37 - 6:39] and describe the products and services
[6:39 - 6:40] that you do and the areas that you
[6:40 - 6:42] deliver them to without repeating them
[6:42 - 6:45] over and over.
[6:45 - 6:47] So, we haven't really spoken too much
[6:47 - 6:49] here about the content of the site in
[6:49 - 6:51] terms of headings, meta descriptions,
[6:51 - 6:53] metatitles, that kind of stuff. With
[6:53 - 6:54] those, it's also easy to fall into the
[6:54 - 6:56] trap of thinking you must fit your
[6:56 - 7:00] keywords in no matter what. That isn't
[7:00 - 7:02] the case. Like, we found Google is good
[7:02 - 7:04] at determining what your page is about.
[7:04 - 7:06] So, the headings and the text on your
[7:06 - 7:09] site should be written for visitors. It
[7:09 - 7:10] should be designed for visitors to
[7:10 - 7:12] really quickly understand what your site
[7:12 - 7:14] is about because Google is good enough
[7:14 - 7:16] at figuring that stuff out as well.
[7:16 - 7:18] Google treats your website like a
[7:18 - 7:20] visitor would. So what does that look
[7:20 - 7:22] like in practice? So if I click on this
[7:22 - 7:24] first result here for pizza and press
[7:24 - 7:26] Rudies, this is a nationwide chain.
[7:26 - 7:28] They've got a whole bunch of spots. You
[7:28 - 7:29] see that the heading on their page just
[7:29 - 7:33] says PressWitch Manchester. If I inspect
[7:33 - 7:35] this for the nerds, you'll see that this
[7:35 - 7:38] is a heading one H1. The H1 is just the
[7:38 - 7:40] word press switch. It's not pizza
[7:40 - 7:42] impress. It's not anything keyword
[7:42 - 7:45] stuffy. It's just press switch. I'm not
[7:45 - 7:47] saying that that's what your pages
[7:47 - 7:50] should be like, but again, it's about
[7:50 - 7:52] looking at the actual examples that show
[7:52 - 7:54] up on Google and deciding whether there
[7:54 - 7:56] really are these hard and fast rules.
[7:56 - 7:57] Now, despite what I said about that you
[7:57 - 7:58] shouldn't be trying to squeeze keywords
[7:58 - 8:00] into every heading, even if it doesn't
[8:00 - 8:02] read naturally, you should probably try
[8:02 - 8:03] and fit your keywords into your
[8:03 - 8:05] headings. You know, there's two sides to
[8:05 - 8:07] this coin. that is balancing the SEO
[8:07 - 8:08] benefits and that's making it usable for
[8:08 - 8:11] readers. And if you can fit a keyword
[8:11 - 8:12] into your heading in a way that reads
[8:12 - 8:14] naturally, then great. Looking at the
[8:14 - 8:15] rest of the content on this readers
[8:15 - 8:17] page, there's not an awful lot to it
[8:17 - 8:19] really. You know, they list the menus
[8:19 - 8:21] and the link off to deliver and Uber
[8:21 - 8:22] Eats, but there's nothing specific in
[8:22 - 8:24] here that's about press. And that's
[8:24 - 8:26] because Google's taken a lot more into
[8:26 - 8:28] account for this page's ranking than the
[8:28 - 8:30] specific content that's on it. Like this
[8:30 - 8:32] page hardly has any content on it
[8:32 - 8:34] really. You know, it's got maybe six
[8:34 - 8:36] lines of unique content on it. But
[8:36 - 8:38] Google knows that Rudies is the biggest
[8:38 - 8:41] chain, the biggest name, and the biggest
[8:41 - 8:43] sit down place in Press Twitch to have a
[8:43 - 8:46] pizza. So, despite there being much
[8:46 - 8:48] better options, as far as I'm concerned,
[8:48 - 8:50] that have been around for longer, that
[8:50 - 8:52] are more local and independent, that
[8:52 - 8:54] someone might actually prefer, the
[8:54 - 8:57] domain name Rudy's Pizza.co.uk UK has so
[8:57 - 8:59] much kudos in Google's eyes that this
[8:59 - 9:02] page can rank despite not really having
[9:02 - 9:04] any content on it about pizza in
[9:04 - 9:06] PressWitch. It's kind of unfair. There's
[9:06 - 9:07] a whole bunch of other places in
[9:07 - 9:09] PressWitch that would be better and I
[9:09 - 9:11] think should be showing instead. But
[9:11 - 9:12] Google tries to prioritize the safest
[9:12 - 9:15] results and the Rudy's Pizza domain name
[9:15 - 9:17] will have people mentioning it all over
[9:17 - 9:20] the UK in pretty positive terms.
[9:20 - 9:21] Actually, none of the pressed places are
[9:21 - 9:24] ranking that well. So, what's making
[9:24 - 9:26] Rudy's rank well?
[9:26 - 9:28] Well, as we said, aside from the
[9:28 - 9:30] mentions of Rudy's Pizza all over the
[9:30 - 9:32] internet, they've also got an awful lot
[9:32 - 9:34] of Google reviews, especially
[9:34 - 9:36] considering they've only been around for
[9:36 - 9:39] less than a year. The two local places,
[9:39 - 9:41] Cooku and Chroma, have got more. But in
[9:41 - 9:43] the time span, Ruders have done an
[9:43 - 9:44] amazing job of collecting so many
[9:44 - 9:47] reviews really. So, that's kind of
[9:47 - 9:48] testament to putting the effort into
[9:48 - 9:50] trying to get some good Google reviews
[9:50 - 9:52] because it'll bump you up the rankings
[9:52 - 9:54] even if your web because it'll bump you
[9:54 - 9:56] up the rankings regardless of the
[9:56 - 9:59] content of your website. I'm diverting a
[9:59 - 10:01] bit from keywords here, so forgive me.
[10:01 - 10:03] Okay, I hope this has been helpful.
[10:03 - 10:05] There's so much we could talk about in
[10:05 - 10:07] terms of keywords really. I could be
[10:07 - 10:09] going on for hours, but I think it's
[10:09 - 10:11] probably better to keep each video kind
[10:11 - 10:13] of reasonably quickly digestible.
[10:13 - 10:15] So, I suppose the main takeaway from
[10:15 - 10:17] this is to remember that Google's
[10:17 - 10:19] algorithm is really clever and they're
[10:19 - 10:21] not looking for exact matches. If you
[10:21 - 10:24] can naturally fit an exact match for the
[10:24 - 10:25] keyword that someone's searching for
[10:25 - 10:27] into the text of your website, then
[10:27 - 10:30] excellent. But don't fret too much if
[10:30 - 10:32] you can't do it. It's better instead to
[10:32 - 10:34] send lots of signals to Google that make
[10:34 - 10:36] it really clear what you do for your
[10:36 - 10:38] business and why your customer should
[10:38 - 10:42] choose you. and also of course to try
[10:42 - 10:44] and get lots of good Google Maps reviews
[10:44 - 10:47] from real customers.
[10:47 - 10:49] Okay, I hope this was helpful. I've put
[10:49 - 10:51] a poll in the channel for some other
[10:51 - 10:53] video ideas.
[10:53 - 10:55] So, please do participate in that if you
[10:55 - 10:57] get a second.
[10:57 - 10:58] And if you enjoy this podcast, it'd be
[10:58 - 11:00] great if you could tell a friend about
[11:00 - 11:02] it. It's still bringing in hardly any
[11:02 - 11:04] income really. And it would be nice if I
[11:04 - 11:06] could make this be a more substantial
[11:06 - 11:08] part of my wage really. Anyway, I'm
[11:08 - 11:10] building up a library of useful guides
[11:10 - 11:13] that hopefully future subscribers will
[11:13 - 11:15] be able to use and I think and hopefully
[11:15 - 11:19] provides a good bit of value.
[11:20 - 11:22] Anyway, that's enough waffling. Over and
[11:22 - 11:26] out. Take care.
