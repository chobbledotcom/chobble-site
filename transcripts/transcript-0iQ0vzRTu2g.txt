[0:02 - 0:05] Be concise. I want to talk today a
[0:05 - 0:08] little bit about being concise on your
[0:08 - 0:10] website and what that means. So, to
[0:10 - 0:12] start with the definition of concise, I
[0:12 - 0:15] haven't actually looked this up, but if
[0:15 - 0:17] you're talking about being concise, you
[0:17 - 0:19] really mean conveying the information
[0:19 - 0:21] that's needed as straightforwardly as
[0:21 - 0:24] possible. This is a problem that I see
[0:24 - 0:26] all the time on people's websites.
[0:26 - 0:28] often, I think, because they've either
[0:28 - 0:30] copied someone else's content or they've
[0:30 - 0:33] used AI to generate text for the site
[0:33 - 0:35] and then they haven't edited it. This
[0:35 - 0:36] can result in pages that use a lot of
[0:36 - 0:39] words to not say an awful lot. Here's an
[0:39 - 0:41] example I've made on the trouble
[0:41 - 0:44] template demo website about loft
[0:44 - 0:46] conversions. This is a website, a
[0:46 - 0:48] fictional website for a building
[0:48 - 0:51] company. And I've written a page here
[0:51 - 0:53] using some AI waffle about loft
[0:53 - 0:55] conversions. And this page is pretty
[0:55 - 0:56] normal for the kind of stuff that I
[0:56 - 0:58] regularly see on the internet,
[0:58 - 1:00] especially when people have used it AI.
[1:00 - 1:01] So here we've got the content for the
[1:01 - 1:02] page. We've got a gallery that's got a
[1:02 - 1:04] single picture in. On the right hand
[1:04 - 1:05] column, we've got an about section. And
[1:05 - 1:07] to read the content that's in this about
[1:07 - 1:09] section, first we've got a header that
[1:09 - 1:10] says loft conversions Manchester.
[1:10 - 1:13] Transform your unused space. Then it
[1:13 - 1:16] says, create your dream room in the
[1:16 - 1:17] heart of Manchester. And I'm going to
[1:17 - 1:19] read this out loud and then I'm going to
[1:19 - 1:21] get into the specifics of why it's not
[1:21 - 1:22] great. Okay, so it says, "Are you
[1:22 - 1:24] looking to add valuable living space to
[1:24 - 1:26] your Manchester home without the hassle
[1:26 - 1:28] of moving? Our professional loft

[3:46 - 3:48] Now, hopefully when you heard me reading
[3:48 - 3:50] all that out, you thought this all
[3:50 - 3:52] sounds very professional, but hopefully
[3:52 - 3:54] you realized as well that I didn't
[3:54 - 3:56] really say anything about the business.
[3:56 - 3:59] I said an awful lot of words, but
[3:59 - 4:01] nowhere in there did I say any real
[4:01 - 4:02] specifics about getting a loft
[4:02 - 4:04] conversion from this company. I didn't
[4:04 - 4:07] mention anything about potential prices,
[4:07 - 4:10] about guarantees, time scales. I didn't
[4:10 - 4:12] even give any proof about the potential
[4:12 - 4:15] increase to your home's value.
[4:15 - 4:19] I used a lot of words to say very, very
[4:19 - 4:22] little. This text on here could describe
[4:22 - 4:24] basically any loft conversion company in
[4:24 - 4:27] Manchester. But if you asked AI to
[4:27 - 4:29] generate a page for you about loft
[4:29 - 4:31] conversions in Manchester, it would
[4:31 - 4:32] probably come up with something pretty
[4:32 - 4:34] similar to this because that's what I
[4:34 - 4:35] did. And this is the page that has
[4:35 - 4:37] resulted. So let's also think about what
[4:37 - 4:39] this page is like to land on as a
[4:39 - 4:41] visitor. You'll see if I scroll down
[4:41 - 4:43] here, it's very long. There's a lot of
[4:43 - 4:45] text. All of the titles are kind of
[4:45 - 4:47] generic. Get started today. the
[4:47 - 4:49] Manchester advantage
[4:49 - 4:52] popularly uses for a new space. It's all
[4:52 - 4:54] quite broad and some of you use phrases
[4:54 - 4:56] that sound pretty cliche like create
[4:56 - 4:59] your dream room. And also a lot of the
[4:59 - 5:00] things that it's saying are kind of
[5:00 - 5:02] redundant. We know that the person who's
[5:02 - 5:04] landing on the page knows what a loft
[5:04 - 5:05] conversion is because that's what
[5:05 - 5:08] they've searched for. This isn't a page
[5:08 - 5:11] that explains what a loft conversion is.
[5:11 - 5:12] Or this shouldn't be a page that
[5:12 - 5:14] explains what a loft conversion is. It
[5:14 - 5:18] should be a page that sells the idea of
[5:18 - 5:19] our company being the one that someone
[5:19 - 5:22] chooses for a loft conversion.
[5:22 - 5:24] So, how could we improve this page? That
[5:24 - 5:26] brings me on to the point of today's
[5:26 - 5:29] post, which is about being concise.
[5:29 - 5:30] Being concise means that you're
[5:30 - 5:32] respecting your visitors time. Someone
[5:32 - 5:34] who lands on this page has got a lot of
[5:34 - 5:35] reading to do, and they're not going to
[5:35 - 5:37] learn an awful lot about your company
[5:37 - 5:39] even when they do do it. This results in
[5:39 - 5:42] a pretty frustrating visitor experience
[5:42 - 5:43] from a search engine point of view as
[5:43 - 5:45] well. Remember that search engines are
[5:45 - 5:48] using very clever AI to determine what
[5:48 - 5:50] the content on a page is about. And the
[5:50 - 5:53] content on this very verbose page is
[5:53 - 5:55] really just about the general idea of
[5:55 - 5:57] loft conversions. There's nothing in
[5:57 - 5:58] there specifically about the way that
[5:58 - 6:00] this company would convert your loft.
[6:00 - 6:02] Now, let's click through to a more
[6:02 - 6:05] concise version that I've written up
[6:05 - 6:06] here. We've got the same sort of stuff.
[6:06 - 6:08] is about loft conversions in Manchester,
[6:08 - 6:10] but I'll read the content out for you.
[6:10 - 6:12] Need more room? We'll convert your loft
[6:12 - 6:14] in just 6 to 8 weeks with prices
[6:14 - 6:17] averaging around Â£30,000. All loft
[6:17 - 6:18] conversions come with a 15-year
[6:18 - 6:21] insurancebacked guarantee. Loft
[6:21 - 6:23] conversions add 15 to 20% to your house
[6:23 - 6:24] value, and then we're linked to the
[6:24 - 6:27] source. Why choose Manchester loft
[6:27 - 6:30] conversions? We're local. 1900 to 1930
[6:30 - 6:32] semis are our bread and butter. 90% of
[6:32 - 6:34] jobs need no planning permission. We
[6:34 - 6:36] have a 15-ear structural guarantee.
[6:36 - 6:39] There's 25% payment up front. And then
[6:39 - 6:41] we do everything insulation, electrics,
[6:41 - 6:43] windows, storage, even plumbing. And
[6:43 - 6:45] then we briefly list the types of
[6:45 - 6:47] conversions we do. Vlux, dharma, hip
[6:47 - 6:49] gable, mansad. Some popular uses are
[6:49 - 6:51] bedroom, home office, playroom, guest
[6:51 - 6:54] room, art, studio. And then we mention
[6:54 - 6:55] that we get a free consultation where
[6:55 - 6:56] we'll measure up and give you a proper
[6:56 - 6:59] quote that's valid for 18 months. We've
[6:59 - 7:00] converted lofts across all of North
[7:00 - 7:02] Manchester including Preswitch,
[7:02 - 7:04] Whitefield, Ragcliffe, Bur and
[7:04 - 7:05] Middleton. Then we've got a features
[7:05 - 7:08] list that shows 3D visualization before
[7:08 - 7:10] we begin. Skip hire and waste removal
[7:10 - 7:12] included dedicated point of contact
[7:12 - 7:13] throughout. And then we've got some
[7:13 - 7:15] specifications where we reiterate the
[7:15 - 7:17] timeline 4 to 6 weeks from initial
[7:17 - 7:19] meeting. The warranties 15 years
[7:19 - 7:21] structural 3 years from the finish. The
[7:21 - 7:24] insulation 300 mm plus which exceeds the
[7:24 - 7:27] building ress by 25%. And then load
[7:27 - 7:30] capacity 150 kg per meter squared. So
[7:30 - 7:32] you'll notice that reading out this
[7:32 - 7:35] concise description of the loft
[7:35 - 7:37] conversion product took way less time.
[7:37 - 7:39] Not only did it take less time though,
[7:39 - 7:41] we also conveyed a lot more information.
[7:41 - 7:44] We included details about the timelines.
[7:44 - 7:46] We included details about prices, about
[7:46 - 7:48] guarantees. We even mentioned how thick
[7:48 - 7:51] the insulation is and what the load
[7:51 - 7:53] capacity is likely to be. Someone who
[7:53 - 7:55] reads this product description is very
[7:55 - 7:57] likely to find out the answers to the
[7:57 - 7:59] thing they're looking for. And when
[7:59 - 8:00] Google analyze this page for their
[8:00 - 8:02] search rankings, they'll be aware that
[8:02 - 8:04] this page contains specifics about the
[8:04 - 8:06] business that's hosting the information.
[8:06 - 8:08] It isn't just very general information
[8:08 - 8:09] that applies to any kind of loft
[8:09 - 8:11] conversion. I also on this one included
[8:11 - 8:13] more pictures in the gallery because
[8:13 - 8:14] some visitors will click around on
[8:14 - 8:16] there. It's important for your gallery
[8:16 - 8:18] to look nice. And I use the feature and
[8:18 - 8:20] the specification systems of the content
[8:20 - 8:22] management system to break those
[8:22 - 8:25] specifics out into more easily scanned
[8:25 - 8:27] lists. Now I'm going to show you on the
[8:27 - 8:30] admin side what this looks like. You see
[8:30 - 8:33] in my for those description, I've got
[8:33 - 8:36] one really big long product description
[8:36 - 8:38] and then I'm not using the features or
[8:38 - 8:40] the specs system on my CNS and I've only
[8:40 - 8:42] got one picture in the gallery and I
[8:42 - 8:44] also haven't re even filled in the
[8:44 - 8:46] header text, meta description, metatitle
[8:46 - 8:48] or subtitles. When I compare this to my
[8:48 - 8:51] concise product, you'll see I've got a
[8:51 - 8:53] much shorter description, but then I've
[8:53 - 8:55] used all of the features of my CMS
[8:55 - 8:57] system. I've filled in some features. I
[8:57 - 8:59] filled in some specs. I've uploaded a
[8:59 - 9:01] bunch of pictures to the gallery and
[9:01 - 9:04] I've filled in all of the meta content
[9:04 - 9:05] and subtitles, header text, everything
[9:05 - 9:08] like that. Despite having less content
[9:08 - 9:10] and being easier to read and
[9:10 - 9:13] significantly less words, this product
[9:13 - 9:15] page is way easier for a visitor to
[9:15 - 9:18] understand and much more likely to
[9:18 - 9:21] result in a sale than the very long
[9:21 - 9:24] verbose version. Okay, I hope this was
[9:24 - 9:26] useful for you. As always, if you've got
[9:26 - 9:28] any questions, please leave a comment.
[9:28 - 9:30] And if you've got any ideas for future
[9:30 - 9:34] posts, I'm all ears.
