# Lovely Reviews

As Chobble is a pretty new business I don't have lots of reviews, but this page includes some nice words people have said about my web development / search engine optimisation work over recent months.

> "I've known Stefan for the last 7 years. He's genius for ranking well SEO work. He knows everything about ranking well on different platforms due to my old business. Since I've launched my new business, I got my new website done of him really well presented seo everything about it was perfect, he's the best at what he does, anything I need to know about media sharing content tags ect always ask for his knowledge, he's happy to guide me no that's what now that's what you call a service, good luck with your new adventure, will defo recommend 🫶🏼"

> I've worked with Stef at Chobble over the years and can confidently say he's one of the most transparent, trustworthy, and knowledgeable developers out there.
>
> Highly recommend Stef to any business or individual looking for reliable and ethical web and software support. I wouldn’t hesitate to work with him again!

> Stefan knows his stuff with SEO and websites and gives great advice. I only joined 6 days ago and with the advice I've been given one of my websites went from 7th to 2nd within 5 days, really is great advice with no messing about. The price for the knowledge is great. Why pay £100's or £1000s of pounds when you can learn to do it yourself?

> Stefan at Chobble has designed my website and helped me build an online profile. He is so knowledgeable and professional, as I am useless at technical online stuff he has simplified it to a point where I now find it easy to edit my own website and customers have increased tenfold. I would highly recommend using Chobble for your business.

> Stefan has always been very helpful and knowledgeable regarding websites and SEO since we first met him, probably around 2013. It was a no brainer to work with him when he started Chobble as the tips and information provided are extremely helpful.
