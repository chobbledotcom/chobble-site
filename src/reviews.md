# Lovely Reviews

As Chobble is a pretty new business I don't have lots of reviews, but this page includes some nice words people have said about my web development / search engine optimisation work over recent months.

> "Working with Chobble has been a dream! I was really daunted by the prospect of building a new website with a developer - having not much experience myself I was concerned I’d feel separated from the process which would have been difficult as my business is so close to my heart. I needn’t have worried at all because I felt completely involved in every step of the way! All of the code is open source which means you have full access and can get involved in editing from your side (if you like). I loved that Chobble provides the option of a simpler way for you to edit your site too (so it’s not all html) which I found to be a lot less clunky than other well known website platforms I’ve tried in the past. Anything I was stuck with, Stefan was always there to help and nothing ever seemed like too much trouble. Stefan also gave me great advice on setting up a new domain, email list provider and more. I really appreciated the Chobble Patreon too which comes with a wealth of wisdom and tips for how to get the best out of your website. Finally Chobble offers a 50% discount for vegans, charities, artists and musicians which makes this incredible value for money and it’s nice to know you’re working with an ethical business too! I am so happy with my new website, thank you!!"

> "Have known Stefan for about 10 years when I signed up to a large web developer he worked for, who hosted websites in the industry I was in. When Stef left this company, it was very noticeable. He is the goat! There isn’t anything website related, Google related, hosting related, email related, seo related that he doesn’t know! When I found out he was doing his own thing, I jumped ship straight away and had him rebuild me a brand new website from scratch - exactly to my liking. There was nothing he couldn’t do. I wasn’t restricted to certain designs, layouts or templates. It was a 100% custom build with his input, knowledge and recommendations along the way. There isn’t anything he doesn’t know or can’t do. My website was built pretty quick and tweaks done before it went live. Stefan has been responsive and provided lots of guidance for all sorts of issues I’ve had (including my iPhone settings when sorting the emails on my phone). The handover and support has been brilliant. Stefan knows his stuff. I honestly couldn’t recommend him enough."

> "What a pleasure to be working with Stefan again. Stefan is a problem solver by nature who works hard to find solutions to problems. Thank you and looking forward to the next time."

> "I've known Stefan for the last 7 years. He's genius for ranking well SEO work. He knows everything about ranking well on different platforms due to my old business. Since I've launched my new business, I got my new website done of him really well presented seo everything about it was perfect, he's the best at what he does, anything I need to know about media sharing content tags ect always ask for his knowledge, he's happy to guide me no that's what now that's what you call a service, good luck with your new adventure, will defo recommend 🫶🏼"

> I've worked with Stef at Chobble over the years and can confidently say he's one of the most transparent, trustworthy, and knowledgeable developers out there.
>
> Highly recommend Stef to any business or individual looking for reliable and ethical web and software support. I wouldn’t hesitate to work with him again!

> Stefan knows his stuff with SEO and websites and gives great advice. I only joined 6 days ago and with the advice I've been given one of my websites went from 7th to 2nd within 5 days, really is great advice with no messing about. The price for the knowledge is great. Why pay £100's or £1000s of pounds when you can learn to do it yourself?

> Stefan at Chobble has designed my website and helped me build an online profile. He is so knowledgeable and professional, as I am useless at technical online stuff he has simplified it to a point where I now find it easy to edit my own website and customers have increased tenfold. I would highly recommend using Chobble for your business.

> Stefan has always been very helpful and knowledgeable regarding websites and SEO since we first met him, probably around 2013. It was a no brainer to work with him when he started Chobble as the tips and information provided are extremely helpful.
