# Automating Things with AI

Save hours on repetitive website tasks using AI the right way - without the risks.

## Why Watch This Video?

If you're spending ages on tedious tasks like checking meta descriptions, rewriting emails, or analysing your site content, AI can help. But most people either avoid it completely or use it wrong. This video shows you the safe, practical middle ground.

## What You'll Learn

**Audit Your Entire Site in Seconds**
Give AI your sitemap and it'll check every page for missing meta descriptions, poor titles, and SEO issues. What would take you hours is done instantly.

**Turn Rough Notes into Professional Messages**
Quickly transform "not available Saturday but Sunday Monday Tuesday" into polished customer correspondence that matches your tone.

**Avoid Costly AI Mistakes**
Learn what AI should never do (business decisions, unedited public content, customer support) so you get the benefits without the risks.

## Who This Helps

Perfect for busy business owners who want to save time on repetitive tasks but are wary of AI. Also great if you've tried AI but found the results too generic or unreliable.
