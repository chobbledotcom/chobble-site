# Automating Things with AI

Practical examples of using AI to automate simple website tasks - whilst avoiding the pitfalls.

## What AI Should NOT Do

First, the warnings:
- Don't put AI in charge of business decisions
- Don't let it write public-facing content without full editing
- Don't have it answer customer support queries directly

## What AI Excels At

**Example 1: Sitemap & Meta Description Audit**
- Give AI your sitemap URL (usually yoursite.com/sitemap.xml)
- It fetches all page URLs and analyses each one
- Checks for missing meta descriptions and title optimisation
- Provides specific recommendations for improvements
- A manual process that would take hours done in seconds

**Example 2: Message Rewriting**
- Create a prompt telling AI your writing style preferences
- Paste rough customer messages
- Get back properly formatted, friendly responses
- Example: "not available Saturday, but Sunday Monday Tuesday" becomes professional correspondence

## Key Takeaway

AI works best for automating simple, repetitive tasks that have clear parameters. It branches one instruction into multiple smaller jobs efficiently - like checking every URL in a sitemap. Use it as a time-saving tool, not a replacement for human judgment.

Works with Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, or any modern AI model.
