# Automating Things with AI

AI's really useful for automating boring website tasks if you know what you're doing. This video shows practical examples like feeding your sitemap to AI and having it check every page for missing meta descriptions or dodgy titles - what would take hours done in seconds.

Also covers turning rough notes into proper emails, and more importantly, what NOT to use AI for (like unedited public content or making business decisions). It shows you the safe middle ground between avoiding AI completely and trusting it with everything. Very handy if you're spending ages on repetitive tasks.
