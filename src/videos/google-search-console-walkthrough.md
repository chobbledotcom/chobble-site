# Google Search Console Walkthrough for Small Businesses

Want to know why your website's not showing up in Google? Or which search terms actually bring you visitors? Google Search Console tells you all this for free, but most small business owners don't even know it exists or find it really confusing.

**Prefer reading to watching? [Click here to read my guide (10-minute read)](/guides/google-search-console/).**

This video walks you through the bits that actually matter - like seeing exactly what people search for to find you (sometimes really surprising), checking if Google's indexed all your pages properly, and getting alerts when something goes wrong. It shows you 16 months of data about your site's performance, where visitors come from, and which pages work best. It takes about 20 minutes to understand the basics, but it'll change how you think about your website. Also covers the crucial email settings - turn them on or you'll miss important warnings about your site.
