# Keywords & Keyword Stuffing

Stop cramming keywords everywhere thinking it'll help you rank - it won't. This video explains how Google actually understands keywords these days (spoiler: they're clever enough to know a pizza recipe page is about making pizza without you saying it 50 times).

I'll show you examples straight from Google's spam policies of what not to do, and why writing naturally works better than forcing keywords where they don't belong. Also covers the difference between someone searching "pizza" (could want anything) versus "pizza in Prestwich" (wants to order now). Proper useful if you've been told to "use more keywords" but your content sounds like a robot wrote it.
