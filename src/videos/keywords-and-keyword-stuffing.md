# Keywords & Keyword Stuffing

A practical explanation of how Google understands keywords and why cramming them into your content backfires.

## What This Video Covers

**Understanding Keywords:**
- Keywords are simply the words people type into search engines
- Google is clever enough to understand context - it doesn't need exact phrase matches
- A recipe page can rank for "how to make pizza" without using that exact phrase

**Search Intent Matters:**
- "Pizza" - vague intent, could be buying or learning
- "How to make pizza" - clearly informational, won't buy anything
- "Pizza in Prestwich" - transactional, likely to order

**Why Keyword Stuffing Fails:**
- Google specifically penalises keyword stuffing in their spam policies
- Examples include listing cities/regions repeatedly or unnaturally repeating phrases
- The goal is to be clear about what you offer without awkward repetition

**Practical Advice:**
- Write naturally about your products and services
- Don't feel pressured to squeeze exact phrases into your content
- A pizza shop doesn't need to say "pizza in Prestwich" repeatedly - just be clear you sell pizza and where you're located

Google's own example of keyword stuffing is surprisingly mild - many sites do far worse. Focus on clear, natural content that helps your visitors.
