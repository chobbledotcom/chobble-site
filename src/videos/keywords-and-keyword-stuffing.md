# Keywords & Keyword Stuffing

Stop worrying about cramming keywords into your content. Learn how to write naturally whilst still ranking well on Google.

## Why Watch This Video?

If you're anxious about using the "right" keywords or worried you're not mentioning them enough, this video will put your mind at ease. You'll discover why Google actually penalises keyword stuffing and how to write content that ranks without sounding robotic.

## What You'll Learn

**Write Naturally and Still Rank**
Google understands context - a recipe page can rank for "how to make pizza" without using that exact phrase. You don't need to force keywords where they don't belong.

**Avoid Google Penalties**
See real examples from Google's own spam policies showing what NOT to do. Many businesses accidentally stuff keywords thinking it helps - it doesn't.

**Match Search Intent**
Understand the difference between someone searching "pizza" (vague) versus "pizza in Prestwich" (ready to buy) and write accordingly.

## Who This Helps

Perfect for business owners who've been told to "use more keywords" but find their content sounds unnatural. Also ideal if you've been penalised or your rankings have dropped after trying to optimise for keywords.
