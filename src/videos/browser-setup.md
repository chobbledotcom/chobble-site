# Browser Setup: Block Adverts & Cookie Popups, Save Bookmarks, Use a Password Manager

Spending time on the internet can be painful. Setting your browser up properly can remove some of that friction - and this video covers my four favourite ways to do that.

## Essential Browser Setup

1. **Ad Blocker** - Remove intrusive advertising
2. **Cookie Popup Blocker** - Skip annoying consent forms
3. **Bookmark Management** - Organise frequently visited sites
4. **Password Manager** - Secure and convenient login storage

These simple changes make browsing faster, safer, and less frustrating.
