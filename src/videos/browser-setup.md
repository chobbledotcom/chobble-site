# Browser Setup: Block Adverts & Cookie Popups, Save Bookmarks, Use a Password Manager

Frustrated with slow-loading websites plastered with ads? Tired of clicking through cookie popups on every site? If you're spending significant time online for work, a poorly configured browser is costing you hours every week.

## Why Watch This Video?

If you're sick of intrusive advertising slowing down your browsing, annoying cookie banners interrupting your workflow, and the security risk of weak passwords, this video shows four essential browser improvements that will transform your internet experience.

## What You'll Learn

**Eliminate Digital Annoyances:**
- Block intrusive ads that slow down websites (and your work)
- Automatically dismiss GDPR cookie banners without clicking
- Speed up page loading by blocking tracking scripts

**Boost Your Productivity:**
- Set up one-click access to frequently used websites
- Sync bookmarks and passwords across all your devices
- Create efficient workflows with strategic bookmark organisation

**Improve Your Security:**
- Use strong, unique passwords without memorisation
- Choose between built-in Firefox sync and premium password managers
- Migrate gradually from weak passwords to bulletproof security

## Why Firefox?

Firefox consistently makes improvements that benefit users, whilst browsers like Chrome often degrade the user experience over time. Firefox remains the recommended choice for a better internet experience.

## Essential Browser Extensions

### 1. Ublock Origin (Ad Blocker)
- **Install from**: Firefox Add-ons (ensure you get "Ublock Origin", not just "Ublock")
- **Benefits**: Blocks intrusive advertising and makes websites load much faster
- **Performance impact**: Can block 190+ scripts on ad-heavy sites like Daily Mail
- **Pro tip**: Enable in private windows for complete ad blocking

### 2. I Still Don't Care About Cookies
- **What it does**: Automatically dismisses GDPR cookie banners
- **Why "Still"**: Choose "I Still Don't Care About Cookies" over the original version
- **Result**: No more clicking through annoying cookie popups on every website

## Bookmark Management Strategy

### Effective Bookmarking Techniques:
- **Bookmark frequently visited sites** in the toolbar for one-click access
- **Save deep links** to skip multiple clicks (e.g., bookmark login pages directly)
- **Organise by purpose**: Keep work-related bookmarks easily accessible
- **Show toolbar permanently**: Right-click bookmark bar → Always show

**Example**: Instead of bookmarking the homepage and clicking "Login", bookmark the login page directly to save clicks every time.

## Password Management

### Built-in Firefox Sync:
- **Basic solution**: Firefox can save and sync passwords across devices
- **Setup**: Menu → Sync and Save Data → Create Mozilla account
- **Syncs**: Passwords, bookmarks, and tabs across all Firefox installations

### Recommended: Bitwarden
- **Why choose Bitwarden**: Open-source, free password manager
- **Security benefit**: One master password protects all others
- **Convenience**: Random passwords for every site without memorisation
- **Migration**: Gradually move passwords over - no need to change everything at once

## Who This Helps

**Small Business Owners** spending hours daily browsing for work and research

**Digital Workers** frustrated with slow, ad-heavy websites interrupting their productivity

**Privacy-Conscious Users** tired of being tracked across the web by advertising networks

**Anyone** using weak passwords or constantly logging into the same sites repeatedly

**Older Computer Users** whose machines struggle with modern, script-heavy websites

## Results

These four setup changes will make your internet browsing:
- **Faster** - No ads or tracking scripts to load
- **Less frustrating** - No cookie popups to dismiss
- **More efficient** - Quick access to frequently used sites
- **More secure** - Strong, unique passwords for every account

This setup is particularly beneficial if you have an older computer, as blocking ads and scripts significantly reduces the processing load.
