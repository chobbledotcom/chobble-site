# "Forward"-links and a Broken Link Checker

Are broken links on your website making you look unprofessional? While everyone obsesses over getting backlinks, most businesses ignore the linking strategy that's completely under their control - and it's costing them trust and conversions.

## Why Watch This Video?

If you want visitors to explore more of your content, trust your recommendations, and see you as a helpful resource (not just someone trying to sell them something), this video reveals linking strategies that transform browsers into buyers and one-time visitors into repeat customers.

## What You'll Learn

**Master Strategic Link Placement:**
- Link at the exact moment of interest (not buried in navigation)
- Create seamless pathways through your content
- Guide visitors naturally to what they need next

**Build Trust Through External Linking:**
- Why linking to competitors actually helps your business
- How external links demonstrate expertise and transparency
- Turn researchers into customers with comprehensive resources

**Maintain Professional Standards:**
- Find and fix broken links that damage credibility
- Use Dr. Link Check to automatically audit your entire website
- Prevent the embarrassment of sending visitors to dead pages

## The Forgotten Side of Linking

**Backlinks vs Forward Links:**
- **Backlinks**: Other people's websites linking to yours (everyone talks about these)
- **Forward links**: You linking to pages on your own site or external websites (often neglected)

Both types of links provide value to visitors and search engines by creating a connected web of useful information.

## Strategic Link Placement

### In-Context Linking Benefits:
- **Immediate relevance**: Links appear exactly where visitors are reading about that topic
- **No hunting required**: Visitors don't need to navigate away to find what interests them
- **Better user experience**: Seamless flow from interest to information

### Practical Examples:
- "Everything I do is released as **open source**" → Links to source code repository
- "Very transparent and honest **pricing**" → Links directly to pricing page  
- "I write **guides** about building websites" → Links to guides section

**Philosophy**: Link at the moment of interest rather than forcing visitors to hunt through navigation menus.

## External Linking Strategy

### Why Link Externally:
- **Provides comprehensive value** to visitors seeking to learn about a topic
- **Builds trust** through transparency and openness  
- **Long-term relationship building** rather than just immediate sales focus
- **Attracts quality traffic** from people researching your field

**Example**: When mentioning "Eleventy website", link both to your Eleventy service page AND to eleventy.dev. Some visitors want to hire you, others want to learn - serve both audiences.

## The Problem: Broken Links

### What Causes Links to Break:
- **Expired domains**: Businesses close or websites go offline
- **Changed file names**: Someone renames their pages without redirects
- **Restructured websites**: Companies reorganise their site structure
- **Time**: Links naturally degrade over time

### Why Broken Links Matter:
- **Internal broken links**: Suggest your website isn't maintained properly
- **External broken links**: Create poor user experience 
- **Lost opportunities**: Visitors can't find the information you promised

## Solution: Dr. Link Check

### How Dr. Link Check Works:
1. **Enter your domain**: Simply type your website URL
2. **Automatic crawling**: Follows all links throughout your entire website
3. **Comprehensive checking**: Tests both internal and external links
4. **Clear reporting**: Shows exactly which links are broken and where they appear

### Using the Results:
- **Review broken links**: Click through to see which links are failing
- **Fix internal links**: Update or redirect broken internal links immediately
- **Update external links**: Find replacement sources or remove outdated external links
- **Regular maintenance**: Run checks periodically to catch new issues

### Real Example Results:
When checking a restaurant website, Dr. Link Check found 12 broken links, mostly from news websites (which are particularly bad at maintaining old URLs). The tool shows exactly which page contains each broken link, making fixes straightforward.

## Best Practices

### Link Maintenance Priority:
1. **Internal links** - Fix immediately (affects site credibility)
2. **External links** - Important but less critical than internal ones

### Regular Maintenance:
- **Run link checks monthly** to catch issues early
- **Focus on high-traffic pages** for maximum impact
- **Replace rather than remove** when possible to maintain value

## Who This Helps

**Small Business Owners** whose website visitors bounce after reading one page

**Service Providers** who want to be seen as industry experts, not just salespeople

**Content Creators** looking to increase engagement and time spent on their website

**Any Business** embarrassed by broken links that make them look outdated and unprofessional

## The Long Game

Effective linking strategy serves multiple audiences:
- **Direct customers** who know they want your service
- **Researchers** who are learning about your field  
- **Future customers** who might employ you after initially learning from your content

By providing comprehensive, well-maintained links, you become a trusted resource that attracts quality traffic and builds long-term business relationships.
