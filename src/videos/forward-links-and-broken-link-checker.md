# "Forward"-links and a Broken Link Checker

Everyone talks about backlinks, but what about the links you control on your own website? This video shows you how to use internal and external links properly - like linking at the exact moment someone's interested in something, not making them hunt through menus. Also covers why linking to competitors can actually help your business (sounds daft but it builds trust).

Then I'll show you Dr. Link Check, a free tool that finds all your broken links automatically. Nothing makes you look more amateur than sending folk to dead pages. It takes minutes to run, shows you exactly what needs fixing. Really useful if you want visitors to actually explore your site instead of bouncing after one page.

## Mentioned Links

Use [Dr. Link Check](https://www.drlinkcheck.com/) to scan your website for broken links - it's free for smaller sites and shows you exactly what needs fixing.
