# "Forward"-links and a Broken Link Checker

Whilst everyone focuses on backlinks (other websites linking to yours), there's equal value in the links you create - both internal links to other pages on your site and external links to other websites. This video explores effective linking strategies and introduces a tool to maintain link quality.

## The Forgotten Side of Linking

**Backlinks vs Forward Links:**
- **Backlinks**: Other people's websites linking to yours (everyone talks about these)
- **Forward links**: You linking to pages on your own site or external websites (often neglected)

Both types of links provide value to visitors and search engines by creating a connected web of useful information.

## Strategic Link Placement

### In-Context Linking Benefits:
- **Immediate relevance**: Links appear exactly where visitors are reading about that topic
- **No hunting required**: Visitors don't need to navigate away to find what interests them
- **Better user experience**: Seamless flow from interest to information

### Practical Examples:
- "Everything I do is released as **open source**" → Links to source code repository
- "Very transparent and honest **pricing**" → Links directly to pricing page  
- "I write **guides** about building websites" → Links to guides section

**Philosophy**: Link at the moment of interest rather than forcing visitors to hunt through navigation menus.

## External Linking Strategy

### Why Link Externally:
- **Provides comprehensive value** to visitors seeking to learn about a topic
- **Builds trust** through transparency and openness  
- **Long-term relationship building** rather than just immediate sales focus
- **Attracts quality traffic** from people researching your field

**Example**: When mentioning "Eleventy website", link both to your Eleventy service page AND to eleventy.dev. Some visitors want to hire you, others want to learn - serve both audiences.

## The Problem: Broken Links

### What Causes Links to Break:
- **Expired domains**: Businesses close or websites go offline
- **Changed file names**: Someone renames their pages without redirects
- **Restructured websites**: Companies reorganise their site structure
- **Time**: Links naturally degrade over time

### Why Broken Links Matter:
- **Internal broken links**: Suggest your website isn't maintained properly
- **External broken links**: Create poor user experience 
- **Lost opportunities**: Visitors can't find the information you promised

## Solution: Dr. Link Check

### How Dr. Link Check Works:
1. **Enter your domain**: Simply type your website URL
2. **Automatic crawling**: Follows all links throughout your entire website
3. **Comprehensive checking**: Tests both internal and external links
4. **Clear reporting**: Shows exactly which links are broken and where they appear

### Using the Results:
- **Review broken links**: Click through to see which links are failing
- **Fix internal links**: Update or redirect broken internal links immediately
- **Update external links**: Find replacement sources or remove outdated external links
- **Regular maintenance**: Run checks periodically to catch new issues

### Real Example Results:
When checking a restaurant website, Dr. Link Check found 12 broken links, mostly from news websites (which are particularly bad at maintaining old URLs). The tool shows exactly which page contains each broken link, making fixes straightforward.

## Best Practices

### Link Maintenance Priority:
1. **Internal links** - Fix immediately (affects site credibility)
2. **External links** - Important but less critical than internal ones

### Regular Maintenance:
- **Run link checks monthly** to catch issues early
- **Focus on high-traffic pages** for maximum impact
- **Replace rather than remove** when possible to maintain value

## The Long Game

Effective linking strategy serves multiple audiences:
- **Direct customers** who know they want your service
- **Researchers** who are learning about your field  
- **Future customers** who might employ you after initially learning from your content

By providing comprehensive, well-maintained links, you become a trusted resource that attracts quality traffic and builds long-term business relationships.
