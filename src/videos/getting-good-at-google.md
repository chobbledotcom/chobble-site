# Getting Good at Google

Advanced Google search operators help you research competitors, find backlink opportunities, and conduct thorough website analysis. This video demonstrates practical search techniques for discovering how other businesses get links and understanding what content Google has indexed.

## Essential Search Operators

### Finding External Links to Websites

**Basic Technique:**
1. **Quote search**: `"example.co.uk"` - finds exact mentions of a domain
2. **Exclude site**: `"example.co.uk" -site:example.co.uk` - shows only external links
3. **Add location**: `"business name" "Manchester"` - narrow by geography

**Example Research Process:**
Searching for `"thisandthatcafe.co.uk" -site:thisandthatcafe.co.uk` reveals:
- Facebook pages and social media profiles
- Review websites (Yelp, TripAdvisor)
- Local business directories
- Food blogs and genuine editorial mentions
- Location-based listing sites

### Analysing Competitor Backlinks

**What You'll Discover:**
- **Easy opportunities**: Yelp, business directories you can sign up for immediately
- **Editorial mentions**: Food bloggers, industry publications (harder to get but very valuable)
- **Local listings**: Area-specific directories and community websites
- **Review platforms**: Where customers leave feedback

**Strategic Approach:**
- **Document easy wins**: Note directories you can join immediately
- **Identify outreach targets**: Bloggers and publications in your industry
- **Understand patterns**: See which types of sites link to successful competitors

### Site-Specific Searches

**Audit Any Website:**
- `site:example.co.uk` - shows all indexed pages from a domain
- `site:example.co.uk "vegan"` - finds specific content on a site
- `site:example.co.uk inurl:products` - searches within URL structures

**Practical Applications:**
- **Content gaps**: See what topics competitors cover that you don't
- **Index checking**: Verify your important pages are in Google
- **Research**: Find specific information on any website quickly

### Geographic and Personalised Results

**Problem**: Google personalises results based on your location
**Solution**: Use Startpage.com for anonymous searches

**When to Use:**
- Researching competitors in other locations
- Getting unbiased search results
- Avoiding location-based filtering

## Advanced Applications

### Backlink Research Strategy
1. **Start with successful competitors** in your industry
2. **Use exclusion searches** to find only external mentions
3. **Categorise opportunities** by difficulty (easy directories vs editorial links)
4. **Plan systematic outreach** to realistic targets
5. **Monitor regularly** for new linking opportunities

### Content Research
- **Find topic gaps** by searching competitor sites for key terms

- **Identify expert sources** frequently mentioned in your field

### Technical SEO Audits

## Pro Tips

**Search Efficiency:**

**Quality over Quantity:**
- **Focus on relevant links**: Geographic and industry relevance matters most
