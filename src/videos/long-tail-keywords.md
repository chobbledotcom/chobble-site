# "Long Tail" Keywords

How small businesses can compete with big brands by targeting specific search phrases.

## Short Tail vs Long Tail

**Short Tail Keywords** (pizza, plumber, dentist):
- Thousands of searches
- Dominated by big brands with huge budgets
- Results show Pizza Hut, Domino's, Wikipedia

**Long Tail Keywords** (vegan pizza in Manchester):
- Fewer searches but very specific intent
- Local businesses can actually compete
- Results show actual local vegan pizza places

## Understanding Searcher Intent

Long tail keywords reveal what people actually want:
- **Informational**: "what are vegan pizza toppings"
- **Navigational**: "Pureza Manchester opening times"
- **Comparison**: "tastiest vegan pizza in Manchester"
- **Transactional**: "book a table pizza Manchester"

When someone searches "solicitor" - could want anything. But "no win no fee cycling accident solicitor Manchester" - you know exactly what they need.

## How to Use Long Tail Keywords

**Find Your Unique Selling Points:**
- Only bike shop in Levenshulme doing repairs while you wait
- Hairdresser specialising in colour corrections
- Equipment supplier using eco-friendly materials
- Locally sourced ingredients

**Create Targeted Content:**
- Dedicate whole pages to specialities (cycling accident claims page for solicitors)
- FAQ sections answering specific questions ("how much does a boiler repair cost?")
- Case studies showcasing unique services
- Location-specific service pages

The trick is matching what makes you special to what people are actually searching for. That's how browsing turns into business.
