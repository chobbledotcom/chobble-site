# Be Concise

Most business websites waffle on for ages without saying anything useful. This video tears apart a typical loft conversion page that uses hundreds of words to say absolutely nothing - no prices, no timescales, just generic rubbish like "create your dream room" that could describe any company.

I'll show you how to replace 200 words of AI-generated fluff with 20 words that actually matter - like "6-8 weeks completion, averaging Â£30,000" or "15-year insurance-backed guarantee". Real information that visitors actually want. It takes 5 minutes to watch, could transform how you write website content.
