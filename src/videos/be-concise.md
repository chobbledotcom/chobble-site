# Be Concise

Is your website drowning visitors in words that say nothing? Most business websites use hundreds of words to communicate what could be said in twenty - and it's costing them customers.

## Why Watch This Video?

If you've ever wondered why your detailed website content isn't converting visitors into customers, this video reveals the fundamental problem: verbose content that wastes people's time while failing to communicate what makes your business different.

## What You'll Learn

**See Generic Website Content Exposed:**
- Why AI-generated "fluff" content drives visitors away
- How generic phrases make every business sound the same
- The exact words and phrases that waste everyone's time

**Master Concise Communication:**
- Replace 200 words of waffle with 20 words of substance
- Transform vague promises into specific, measurable claims
- Communicate your unique value proposition clearly

**Real Before & After Examples:**
- Watch a typical loft conversion page get dissected
- See the powerful rewrite that actually informs visitors
- Learn the formula for meaningful business content

## The Problem: Words Without Substance

This video dissects a typical AI-generated page about loft conversions that uses hundreds of words to say almost nothing:
- No specific prices or timescales
- No real guarantees or proof
- Generic phrases like "create your dream room"
- Could describe any loft conversion company

The result? Visitors have loads to read but learn nothing about your actual business.

## The Concise Alternative

Compare the waffle to this rewrite:
- "6-8 weeks completion, averaging £30,000"
- "15-year insurance-backed guarantee"
- "1900-1930 semis are our bread and butter"
- "90% of jobs need no planning permission"

Real information in a fraction of the words.

## Who This Helps

**Small Business Owners** frustrated that their website content isn't converting visitors into enquiries

**Content Creators** tired of writing long pieces that don't seem to engage readers

**Marketing Teams** looking to improve website performance without massive rewrites

**Anyone** whose business website uses generic phrases that could describe any company

## Why This Matters

**For Visitors:** Being concise respects their time. They're not going to read walls of generic text.

**For SEO:** Search engines use AI to understand content. Verbose pages only communicate vague topics, not what makes your business unique.

**The Root Cause:** Often happens when people copy others' content or use AI without editing. The result is always generic, clichéd, and says nothing specific about your business.

Being concise means conveying needed information as straightforwardly as possible. Your visitors will thank you for it.
