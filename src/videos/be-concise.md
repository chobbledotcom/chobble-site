# Be Concise

A demonstration of why verbose website content fails - and how to fix it.

## The Problem: Words Without Substance

This video dissects a typical AI-generated page about loft conversions that uses hundreds of words to say almost nothing:
- No specific prices or timescales
- No real guarantees or proof
- Generic phrases like "create your dream room"
- Could describe any loft conversion company

The result? Visitors have loads to read but learn nothing about your actual business.

## The Concise Alternative

Compare the waffle to this rewrite:
- "6-8 weeks completion, averaging £30,000"
- "15-year insurance-backed guarantee"
- "1900-1930 semis are our bread and butter"
- "90% of jobs need no planning permission"

Real information in a fraction of the words.

## Why This Matters

**For Visitors:** Being concise respects their time. They're not going to read walls of generic text.

**For SEO:** Search engines use AI to understand content. Verbose pages only communicate vague topics, not what makes your business unique.

**The Root Cause:** Often happens when people copy others' content or use AI without editing. The result is always generic, clichéd, and says nothing specific about your business.

Being concise means conveying needed information as straightforwardly as possible. Your visitors will thank you for it.
