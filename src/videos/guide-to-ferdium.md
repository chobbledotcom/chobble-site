# Guide to Ferdium - A Very Cool Web App Manager

Here's my video giving a quick run-down of the main features of Ferdium, an app I use every day to manage my social media accounts, as well as other websites I visit regularly like my home automation dashboard.

## Useful Custom Websites to Add

Beyond social media, consider adding:
- Google Search Console: https://search.google.com/search-console
- Google Business: https://business.google.com/
- Your email account
- The admin system for your website
- Accounts on websites like Checkatrade

## Pro Tip

On some websites (like Meta Business Suite), clicking the login button opens your web browser, which won't work because your Ferdium session is separate. If this happens, copy/paste the URL back into Ferdium by pressing CTRL+B to display the URL bar.

Please give Ferdium a shot and let me know how you get on!
