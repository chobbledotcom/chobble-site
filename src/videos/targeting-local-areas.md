# Targeting Local Areas on Google SERPs: A Real-ish Example

In this video I spec out a page targeting "Fitness Classes in Whitefield", for a fictional business based in Prestwich. You should be able to adapt it for your own service areas pretty easily!

## Questions to Answer About Each Area

When creating location pages, consider:
- How will residents get to my business?
- What local businesses are similar to mine?
- What makes my business different from them?
- Do I have any testimonials from this area?
- Do I contribute to the community in this area?
- Do the demographics of this area affect my work there?
- Which venues in this area have I worked with?
- What are the logistical quirks of working in this area?
- How long have I been working in this area?

These questions help create unique, valuable content for each location page rather than duplicate content.
