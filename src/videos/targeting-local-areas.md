## Content Creation Process

### Step 1: Research and Documentation
1. **Answer all 9 questions** thoroughly for each target area
2. **Create bullet-point notes** - don't worry about perfect prose yet
3. **Be specific** - avoid generic statements that could apply anywhere

### Step 2: AI-Assisted Framework (Optional)
**Prompt structure:**
> "I'm writing a page for fitness classes in Prestwich targeting Whitefield visitors. The classes are open late and cater to total beginners. Here are my notes about the business and Whitefield: [paste research]. Give me an outline for a webpage targeting Whitefield visitors in concise, informal British English."

**AI output provides:**
- Page structure suggestions
- Content flow ideas
- Key messaging framework

### Step 3: Content Refinement
**What to fix in AI-generated content:**
- **Remove generic language** ("intimidating muscle heads")
- **Add local dialect/tone** appropriate to your area
- **Strengthen call-to-action** with specific contact methods
- **Include pricing and detailed service information**
- **Make it sound authentically like your business**

## Strategic Implementation

### Quality Over Quantity
- **One page per month** is perfectly fine
- **Deep, specific research** beats shallow, generic pages
- **Unique content** for each area - never copy and paste
- **Long-term investment** - pages work forever once created

### Content Must Be Genuinely Different
**Example**: The Whitefield research revealed:
- Specific transport options
- Unique local competitors  
- Area demographics (commuter patterns)
- Local venues and partnerships
- Traffic and timing considerations

**This couldn't be copied to a Radcliffe page** - different area needs different research.

### Success Metrics

- **Improved local search visibility**
- **Targeted traffic** from specific areas
- **Long-term ranking improvements**

## Why This Approach Works
