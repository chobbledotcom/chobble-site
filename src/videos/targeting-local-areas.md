# Targeting Local Areas on Google SERPs: A Real-ish Example

Missing out on customers from nearby towns because they can't find you when they search locally? This video walks through creating location pages using a real example - a Prestwich gym targeting folk in Whitefield. It shows you exactly how to research and write pages that actually work.

**Rather read about this in detail? [Click here to read my guide (8-minute read)](/guides/targeting-specific-areas/).**

I've got 9 questions you need to answer about each area you want to target - stuff like transport links, local competition, what makes you different. Then I show you how to turn that research into a page that's genuinely useful, not just "we also serve X area" rubbish. One good location page a month beats ten copy-paste jobs. It works for any business where people will travel a bit for your service.
