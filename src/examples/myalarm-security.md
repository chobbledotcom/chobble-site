# Websites for Local Businesses

[MyAlarm Security](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk) are a burglar alarm and CCTV company who had an existing website but were pushing up against its limits, and needed something they could fully customise.

I migrated their page content to my [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/), a "ready-ish to go" package for business websites, and then set about approximating their old site's theme - with a few tweaks.

- **Client:** MyAlarm Security
- **Services:** Website development and hosting
- **Website:** [MyAlarmSecurity.co.uk](https://www.myalarmsecurity.co.uk)
- **Source code:** [on GitHub](https://github.com/chobbledotcom/my-alarm-security)

### Technical details

The site is built on the Chobble Template. That's my in-house platform for making sites, but unlike most web agencies I release all of my source code for free, for anyone to use or build on.

But just because the site is based on a template doesn't mean it has to look any specific way - each aspect of the template can be overridden, from the colours, to fonts, to backgrounds, to whole page layouts or features.

I used this flexibility on the MyAlarm site to create a custom homepage with sliding banner, and to lay out the product and category pages to the company's exact specs.

### Search engine friendliness

There have been tonnes of studies showing that fast-loading, straightforward websites are more effective at generating enquiries. The Chobble Template uses a bunch of neat tricks to make pages load near-instantly, like pre-rendering, placeholder images, deferred scripts, and other nerdy stuff - and then I host the sites on blazing-fast SSD storage from Bunny.net.

On top of all that technical whizz-bangery, the template is also really easy to expand, so businesses can create intra-linked pages that target specific search phrases, easy peasy.

And of course, I explain how all of this works to my paid customers so they know exactly what to do.

### Pricing

I charge a [flat hourly fee for all jobs](/prices/) and am totally transparent with you about what I'll do in each of those hours.

As a very experienced developer, most website builds are pretty straightforward to me and much of the work is "already done" in my Chobble Template - but if you want a complex bespoke design or lots of new interactivity I can quote for that too.

For a site of similar complexity to this one, expect prices to **start at about £600**, with monthly hosting costs at **£40** for unlimited support, or **£10** for hosting only.

My prices are discounted 50% for charities, co-operatives, artists, musicians, and vegan businesses.
