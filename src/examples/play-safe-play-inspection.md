Gary is a qualified play equipment inspector based in Chorley, Lancashire, covering the North West. He inspects indoor soft play centres and outdoor playgrounds to BS EN 1176 and BS EN 1177 standards. He needed a professional site that would establish credibility with councils, schools, and holiday parks.

## Blocks layout

This site uses the [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/)'s newer "blocks" layout system. Instead of writing pages as plain markdown, Gary's homepage is built from structured content blocks - stats counters, section headers, image cards, and markdown sections - all defined in simple YAML frontmatter. This gives the page a more designed feel without needing any custom code.

## Content with AI

I worked with Gary to figure out the content for his site using AI. Starting from his experience and qualifications, we shaped the copy into clear service pages covering annual inspections, operational inspections, indoor play, inflatables, and risk assessments. The result is content that accurately reflects Gary's expertise without the usual pain of writing website copy from scratch.

## Editing and support

The site uses [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org/) for content editing, with the CMS trimmed down to only show what's relevant - pages, categories, and reviews. No unnecessary features cluttering the interface. And because Gary pays for ongoing support, he can just send changes on to me whenever he needs something updated.

## Hosting and performance

Like all Chobble Template sites, this is hosted on blazing fast Bunny CDN servers. The site gets **100% scores across the board in Lighthouse** - performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO all maxed out. That's the advantage of static site generation combined with a well-optimised template and global CDN hosting.
