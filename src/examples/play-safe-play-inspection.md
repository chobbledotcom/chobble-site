Gary is a qualified and well-respected play equipment inspector based in Chorley, Lancashire, covering the North West. He inspects indoor soft play centres and outdoor playgrounds to BS EN 1176 and BS EN 1177 standards. While he's an excellent mechanical engineer, he's not technical when it comes to websites and wanted a partner who would manage the tech side for him without any upselling motivations. He needed a professional site that would establish credibility with councils, schools, and holiday parks.

## Blocks layout

This site uses the [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/)'s newer "blocks" layout system. Instead of writing pages as plain markdown, Gary's homepage is built from structured content blocks - stats counters, section headers, image cards, and markdown sections - all defined in simple YAML frontmatter. This gives the page a more designed feel without needing any custom code.

## Content with AI

I worked with Gary to figure out the content for his site over WhatsApp voice notes - he didn't have to type anything up. He just let me know what he wanted to say, and I used AI to transcribe his voice notes and then shape the content into clear service pages covering annual inspections, operational inspections, indoor play, inflatables, and risk assessments. I checked over the content to make sure it was accurate, and sent it on to Gary for review too. The result is content that accurately reflects his expertise without the usual pain of writing website copy from scratch.

## Editing and support

The site uses [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org/) for content editing, with the CMS trimmed down to only show what's relevant - pages, categories, and reviews. No unnecessary features cluttering the interface. And because Gary pays for ongoing support, he can just send changes on to me whenever he needs something updated. But this isn't the only option - if you want to customise permalinks, meta data, and redirects and get really involved in the SEO for your site, you can. It's all totally editable and customisable.

## Hosting and performance

Like all Chobble Template sites, this is hosted on blazing fast Bunny CDN servers. The site gets **100% scores across the board in Lighthouse** - performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO all maxed out. That's the advantage of static site generation combined with a well-optimised template and global CDN hosting.

Because it's built on the Chobble Template, the site also gets periodic updates as I improve the base template. And I have a bunch of other bits set up for each customer too - privacy-respecting analytics through GoatCounter (GDPR compliant, no cookie banners needed), email addresses through Purelymail, and Google Search Console configured for tracking search performance.
