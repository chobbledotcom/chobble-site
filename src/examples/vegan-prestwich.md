# Vegan Prestwich

- **Client:** Vegan Prestwich
- **Services:** Website hosting and social media management
- **Website:** [VeganPrestwich.co.uk](https://veganprestwich.co.uk)

Vegan Prestwich is a website, [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/veganprestwich) and [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich) I've been running with my wife since 2018.

Back then, Prestwich's vegan scene was already good, but hard to discover - we started the site because I'd built directory sites before (like [bouncycastlehire.co.uk](https://www.bouncycastlehire.co.uk)) and knew they could help businesses rank better and drive traffic.

The Facebook group has since grown to 800+ members and our Instagram has 500+ followers. Group activity fluctuates, but 2025's been surprisingly busy - hopefully because more people are going vegan. My wife usually handles Instagram while I sort the Facebook and website.

## My solution

I maintain a directory of local businesses and their vegan offerings. It's completely manual work - I keep an eye on the Facebook group and update the website when people post about the scran or supermarket products they've found. Each business listing includes:

- Quotes from social media and customer reviews
- Photos of meals and menus
- Links to websites and social media
- Address and phone details
- Opening times

The community side is more important than the directory, really. The Facebook group creates a feedback loop where business owners often post to share their vegan updates and members comment on how well they're catering to vegans. It's a welcoming space for people at all stages of their vegan journey - from curious newcomers to long-term veegs.

We've had some brilliant wins over the years. One highlight was emailing Joseph Holts (who own most of Prestwich's pubs) to ask about their beers going vegan - and they actually updated their recipes to make most of their beers vegan! We've also organised real-life meetups and members have hired each other for catering and events.

## Results

The site and community have had a real impact on Prestwich's vegan scene:
