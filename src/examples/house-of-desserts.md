Lutterworth's newest dessert shop came to me seeking a new, easy to update, and super fast loading website to show off their menus and contact information.

At the time, my [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/) didn't have any built-in menu support, so I thought this would be a great opportunity to add that. Many restaurant or cafe websites have their menus hidden in PDF downloads that are awkward to navigate and hard to copy/paste from. I wanted to make something that was as easy to edit as uploading a new PDF, but much more pleasant for visitors to use.

By setting the system up to work with [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org/), the nested and flexible menu system can be edited - for free - without requiring any technical know-how. If we want to update the system in the future to store more data or be organised differently, it's probably a really simple tweak.

Whenever the business changes their text through the PagesCMS editor, the site is re-built in less than a minute. This fast feedback loop provides all the benefits of static sites - really fast websites that can be hosted for cheap - with the flexibility of a full content management system.

Because the site is based on the Chobble Template a tonne of other functionality is available built-in, ready to be activated whenever the business fancies:

- News posts
- Events
- Reviews
- Products
- Team profiles
- Galleries

..And more to come! I'm always improving and updating the template, and because it uses Git, every change and version is stored - so we can roll back to any point in time to fix any issues you have.
