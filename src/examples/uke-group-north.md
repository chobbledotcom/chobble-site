# Websites for Music Teachers

If you teach music - whether that's workshops, one-to-one lessons, or both - you need a website that makes it easy for students to find you, see your session times, and get in touch. I build websites for music teachers that are straightforward to update yourself and handle all the practical bits you need.

**Musicians get 50% off my standard rates** - so a basic site starts from around £100-£200, with hosting from £5/month. [Full pricing details here](/prices/#content).

## Uke Group North example

- **Client:** Uke Group North Community Interest Company
- **Services:** Website development and hosting
- **Website:** [UkeGroupNorth.com](https://www.ukegroupnorth.com)
- **Source code:** [on GitHub](https://github.com/chobbledotcom/uke-group-north)

Uke Group North runs ukulele workshops across Greater Manchester and Lancashire. They needed a website to promote their weekly sessions, share downloadable songbooks, and help people find their nearest group.

The page features information about beginner workshops, one-to-one lessons with Ben, and the benefits of learning ukulele. Navigation links include Workshops, Events, News, About, Reviews, Learn, Support and Contact.](/assets/examples/uke-group-north.png)

### What the site does

The site covers workshop listings with session times and locations, information about one-to-one lessons, and downloadable songbooks in PDF format. There's a news section for updates and events, testimonials from students, and a contact form for enquiries.

### Easy content management

I set the site up with [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org), which means Uke Group North can edit everything themselves through a friendly web interface. They can add news posts, change workshop times and locations, upload new songbooks, add testimonials, and update contact details. They don't need to know any code or mess about with complicated WordPress dashboards. Changes go through GitHub which means every change is backed up and can be undone - there's no way to permanently break things. It's easy to roll back to any point in the site's history.

### Technical details

The site is a [static website](/services/static-websites/#content) built on the [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/#content). Here's what's under the bonnet:

- Built with **Eleventy** - a static site generator using Node JS
- Uses **PagesCMS** for content editing - connects to GitHub and provides a visual editor
- Contact form via **Formspark** with **BotPoison** spam protection
- Automatically builds with **GitHub Actions** whenever content is updated
- Deployed to **Bunny CDN** for fast global delivery
- **Minimal CSS** via SCSS - no heavy frameworks
- **Turbo** for instant page transitions
- Domain registered with **Krystal**
- Fully responsive design
- SEO optimisation

You can view all of this yourself by [clicking here to view the site's source code](https://github.com/chobbledotcom/uke-group-north).

The static approach means low hosting costs, no security patches to worry about, and fast page loads. It's stable and affordable for a music teaching business.

## What music teachers need

Based on working with Uke Group North, here's what I've learned matters for music teaching websites.

People need to quickly find when and where lessons happen. Clear timetables and location details are crucial. Students want to know what to expect, whether you cater to beginners, and what style of teaching you offer.

Downloadable songbooks, chord charts, or practice materials add value and help with SEO. Testimonials from existing students help new people decide to get in touch.

A simple contact form or clear email address is essential, plus phone number if you're comfortable sharing it. A blog or news section for event announcements, new resources, or teaching tips helps keep the site fresh and brings people back.

## Why this approach works for musicians

You can edit it yourself - PagesCMS gives you a straightforward editor, so you don't need to pay someone every time you want to add a songbook or update session times. Static hosting is affordable at £5/month for unmanaged hosting (bug fixes only) or £20/month for managed hosting with ongoing support and marketing help.

The site's source code is yours, hosted on GitHub. If you want to move elsewhere or hire a different developer, you can. Static sites don't have databases to hack or WordPress plugins to update, so they're quick to load and stable.

## 50% discount for musicians

I charge £200/hour for web development (£100/hour for musicians, artists, and writers), with discussions before and after the job free. A basic music teacher website typically takes 1-3 hours to set up using my template, so you're looking at £100-£300 total.

Hosting is £10/month for unmanaged (bug fixes only) or £40/month for managed hosting (updates, marketing support, bug fixes). Both are 50% off for musicians, so £5/month or £20/month respectively.
