# Websites for Music Teachers

If you teach music - whether that's workshops, one-to-one lessons, or both - you need a website that makes it easy for students to find you, see your session times, and get in touch. I build websites for music teachers that are straightforward to update yourself and handle all the practical bits you need.

**Musicians get 50% off my standard rates** - so a basic site starts from around £100-£200, with hosting from £10/month. [Full pricing details here](/prices/).

## UKE Group North Example

- **Client:** UKE Group North Community Interest Company
- **Services:** Website development and hosting
- **Website:** [UKEGroupNorth.com](https://www.ukegroupnorth.com)
- **Source code:** [on GitHub](https://github.com/chobbledotcom/uke-group-north)

UKE Group North runs ukulele workshops across Greater Manchester and Lancashire. They needed a website to promote their weekly sessions, share downloadable songbooks, and help people find their nearest group.

### What the Site Does

The site covers everything a music teaching business needs:

- **Workshop listings** - session times, locations, and what to expect
- **One-to-one lessons** - information about private tuition
- **Downloadable resources** - songbooks and teaching materials in PDF format
- **Testimonials** - quotes from students about their experience
- **News updates** - blog posts about events and developments
- **Contact form** - for enquiries about lessons or bookings

### Easy Content Management

I set the site up with [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org), which means UKE Group North can edit everything themselves through a friendly web interface. They can:

- Add and update news posts
- Change workshop times and locations
- Upload new songbooks
- Add student testimonials
- Update contact details

They don't need to know any code or mess about with complicated WordPress dashboards. Changes go through GitHub which means there's a review step before anything goes live, keeping the site accurate.

### Technical Details

The site is a [static website](/services/static-websites/) built on the [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/). Here's what's under the bonnet:

- Built with **Eleventy** - a static site generator using Node JS
- Uses **PagesCMS** for content editing - connects to GitHub and provides a visual editor
- Contact form via **Formspark** with **BotPoison** spam protection
- Automatically builds with **GitHub Actions** whenever content is updated
- Uses a **Nix Flake** for reproducible builds
- Deployed to **Bunny CDN** for fast global delivery
- **Minimal CSS** via SCSS - no heavy frameworks
- **Turbo** for instant page transitions
- Domain registered with **Krystal**
- Fully responsive design
- SEO optimisation

You can view all of this yourself by [clicking here to view the site's source code](https://github.com/chobbledotcom/uke-group-north).

The static approach means low hosting costs, no security patches to worry about, and fast page loads. It's stable and affordable for a music teaching business.

## What Music Teachers Need

Based on working with UKE Group North, here's what I've learned matters for music teaching websites:

**Session information** - People need to quickly find when and where lessons happen. Clear timetables and location details are crucial.

**Teaching approach** - Students want to know what to expect, whether you cater to beginners, and what style of teaching you offer.

**Resources** - Downloadable songbooks, chord charts, or practice materials add value and help with SEO.

**Social proof** - Testimonials from existing students help new people decide to get in touch.

**Easy contact** - A simple contact form or clear email address, plus phone number if you're comfortable sharing it.

**News updates** - A blog or news section for event announcements, new resources, or teaching tips helps keep the site fresh and brings people back.

## Why This Approach Works for Musicians

**You can edit it yourself** - PagesCMS gives you a straightforward editor, so you don't need to pay someone every time you want to add a songbook or update session times.

**Low ongoing costs** - Static hosting is affordable. The UKE Group North site costs £10/month for hosting (£5 with the musician discount) with unmanaged hosting, or £20/month (£10 discounted) for managed hosting with ongoing support and marketing help.

**You own everything** - The site's source code is yours, hosted on GitHub. If you want to move elsewhere or hire a different developer, you can.

**Fast and secure** - Static sites don't have databases to hack or WordPress plugins to update. They're quick to load and stable.

**Works for years** - I use reproducible builds with Nix, which means the site should keep building reliably for years without maintenance headaches.

## 50% Discount for Musicians

I charge £200/hour for web development (£100/hour for musicians, artists, and writers), with discussions before and after the job free. A basic music teacher website typically takes 1-3 hours to set up using my template, so you're looking at £100-£300 total.

Hosting is £10/month for unmanaged (you handle updates) or £20/month for managed hosting (I help with updates, marketing support, bug fixes). Both are 50% off for musicians, so £5/month or £10/month respectively.
