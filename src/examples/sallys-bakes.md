Sally's Bakes is a local vegan bakery in Bury, Manchester. She makes really delicious vegan pies and pasties, as well as cakes, cookies, and cream eggs, and delivers them to businesses and homes across Manchester and nearby.

## My Solution

I created a simple website that clearly shows Sally's menu (with clicks through to ingredients) and makes it really easy for customers to learn more and get in touch. The site includes all the important information about her products, delivery areas, and how to place orders.

Sally needed a website she could easily edit herself, and so this site is edited through simple text files in a "Git" interface, which might sound technical but is actually really straightforward.

## Technical Details

- Static website built with Jekyll
- Hosted on Neocities
- Perfect Lighthouse performance scores
- Contact form built with FormSpark
- Spam protection via BotPoison
- Facebook page integration
- Links to Instagram profile and HappyCow listing
- Git-based content management
- Fully responsive design

## Ongoing Support

As a website customer Sally receives free access to my Patreon marketing club for business promotion advice. I provide occasional technical help, though her Git-based workflow is largely self-sufficient. We optimised the site for local search terms and it's already ranking pretty well on Google.

## Results

The site gives Sally a professional online presence where customers can easily find product information and place orders. It connects all her social media profiles while remaining simple enough for her to maintain herself, allowing her to focus primarily on her baking business.

## Source Code

The complete source code for this project is available [on my Git forge](https://git.chobble.com/hosted-by-chobble/sallys-bakes). If you own a small food business you can use it to build a website for yourself. Or, you can [get in touch with me](/contact/) and I can make a site for you too!
