# About Chobble

Chobble is me, Stef, from Prestwich, Manchester ([here's my CV](https://stefn.co.uk/cv/)) - a web and software developer with over 20 years of experience working on websites of all sizes - from local charities like [Blue Pits](https://bluepitshousingaction.co.uk) and social groups like [Vegan Prestwich](https://veganprestwich.co.uk) to busy web applications like [Bouncy Castle Network](https://www.bouncycastlenetwork.com) and huge international storefronts like [Bandcamp.com](https://bandcamp.com).

After years of working in other companies I decided to fully commit to freelancing, and started Chobble to:

- Build websites and tools for local organisations and individuals
- Provide honest advice and guidance
- Contribute to the wider open source community

## Transparent & flexible

I charge a [flat per-hour rate](/prices/) for all web development services and tell you exactly what's included for each hour.

I prefer solutions which empower their users and so prioritise open source tools and flexibility over proprietary or locked-in solutions. You should be able to import and export data easily.

I do not force you to host on my server, and I provide instructions for hosting elsewhere or moving away - although you might like to host with me anyway.

I am happy to explain as much about how your website works as you like, and will share all source code by default - [here's my source repository](https://git.chobble.com).

I know many other [tech-adjacent people](/friends/) (eg designers, copywriters, marketers) and are happy to connect you with them if you need their services.

## What does "Chobble" mean?

Either "to chew food", "to talk loudly" or "to calm down" - but really I just chose it because it's a fun word to say.
