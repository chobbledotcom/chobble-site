# Restaurant web design in Prestwich

![This & That's website homepage. The cafe is easy to miss, so the photo shows the alley visitors need to find as its header image. There are two main links, "Home" and "Menu", and we can see TripAdvisor reviews and the start of a description of the business](/assets/examples/this-and-that.png)

Running a restaurant or cafe in Prestwich is hard enough without wrestling with your website. You need something straightforward - showing your **menu**, **hours**, and **location** without clutter or distractions.

## Straightforward websites are better

Many restaurant websites struggle with common problems - PDF menu downloads that are difficult to open on phones, animations that slow down loading times or obscure important information, and contact forms that aren't properly maintained.

I build restaurant websites that put function first. Clear menus displayed as simple web pages, super fast loading times, and up-to-date information and links to help hungry people find you quickly.

## Real results

I've built successful sites for independent cafes and restaurants across Greater Manchester:

[This & That Cafe](/examples/this-and-that/) is Manchester's legendary curry house that's been serving rice and three since 1984. Their website gets their menu in front of customers instantly - no clicks, no PDFs, just the food information people are searching for.

[Sally's Bakes](/examples/sallys-bakes/) in Bury showcases their vegan pies, pasties and cakes with ingredient lists and delivery info. The colourful design reflects their personality while keeping usability at the forefront.

[Avo Coffee](/examples/avo-coffee/) in Haslingden was built using the [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/), featuring instant page loads and a clear structure that makes finding menu items, opening hours and location details effortless.

## Easy peasy updates

The biggest pain with restaurant websites? Updating menus. With my sites, you just:

1. Click your edit bookmark
2. Log in with your email
3. Change any menu item in a simple text box
4. Click save

That's it. No calling developers. No waiting days. No extra charges. Using [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org) and open source tech means you're always in control.

## Transparent pricing

A basic restaurant website starts at about **£600** and just **£300** for vegan businesses - that gets you a professional design based on my proven [Chobble template](/services/chobble-template/), an easy menu management system, mobile-first responsive design, contact form with spam protection, plus setup and training.

Hosting is from **£10/month** for simple sites with paid support, or **£40/month** if you want ongoing support, updates, and personal help implementing the strategies in my [free marketing guides](/guides/) and [videos](/videos/).

**Special offer**: I'm always happy to discuss reducing prices in exchange for meals at your restaurant!

## Local Prestwich web developer

As a lifelong Prestwichian, I can offer something different from remote agencies or Wix / Squarespace-type global corporations. I'll meet you in person to understand your needs properly, show you exactly how to update your site, and be available when you need help. I don't do expensive contracts or hidden fees - I transparently explain exactly what you're paying for.

## Lets get started!

**You deserve a website that helps your business thrive and a technical partner who works in your interest. [Contact me to discuss your restaurant website requirements](/contact/).**
