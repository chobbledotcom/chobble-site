# Web design in Prestwich

Looking for an affordable web designer in Prestwich? I can make you a website from as little as around **£600** (or **£300** for charities, cooperatives, artists, and [vegan businesses](/services/vegan-business-websites/#content) or otherwise sustainable businesses).

As a fellow Prestwichian, I can visit you at your location, you can come to mine, or we can meet at a local cafe or bar to discuss your web design requirements (I'll have a Shindigger at Cuckoo, cheers).

I pride myself on building fast, efficient, accessible and easily-understood websites - ideal for guiding visitors from search engines to the important information as quickly as possible.

## How it works

1. We meet to discuss your requirements _(for free!)_
2. I send a detailed proposal breaking down exactly what you'll get
3. I build your site in 1-2 days for a simple site
4. You get training plus the complete source code and instructions
5. I can host your new site, or you or someone else can

Most delays come from content creation, but you can use my [free guides](/guides/) and [videos](/videos/) for help.

Want a more complex, more visual website with lots going on? I'm happy to help with that too - I can source designers, turn paid-for templates into interactive sites, or build any advanced functionality with Ruby on Rails or other open source platforms.

## Types of websites

I've built sites for businesses across Greater Manchester:

**Restaurants & cafes**: [This & That](/examples/this-and-that/), [Sally's Bakes](/examples/sallys-bakes/), [Avo Coffee](/examples/avo-coffee/)

**Services**: [Renegade Solar](/examples/renegade-solar/) (solar panels), [Blue Pits](/examples/blue-pits/) (housing charity)

**Community**: [Vegan Prestwich](/examples/vegan-prestwich/), [Crumpsall Folk Club](/examples/crumpsall-folk-club/)

**Creative**: [Button Kin Games](/examples/button-kin/)

Each site is built to match the business needs - from simple brochure sites to booking systems.

## Transparent pricing

I charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/) for all jobs and will be very transparent about what each hour of work covers.

Check out my [price calculator](/price-calculator/) for a proper estimate, but typical costs are around:

- **Basic website**: £600-800
- **Website with custom design**: £1,400-1,600
- **Complex functionality**: £2,000+

I offer affordable web hosting from £10/month, or £40/month with ongoing support and personal help implementing the strategies in my [free marketing guides](/guides/) and [videos](/videos/). You can also host your site with Cloudflare pages for no monthly cost at all.

I give a **50% discount** to charities, co-ops, artists, musicians, vegan businesses, and renewable energy companies.

## Why work with me?

**Local support**: Meet in person for training and support - I want to build local partnerships around Prestwich

**No lock-in**: Unlike many web agencies, you get all the code and hosting instructions - you will own your website rather than just renting access to it

**Proven results**: Like helping Renegade Solar rank #1 on Google for "Solar Panel installer Prestwich"

**Platform freedom**: Build exactly what you need without wrestling with Wix or Squarespace limitations

My aim is to build local partnerships with organisations and individuals around Prestwich and to become known as a useful and honest web consultant.
