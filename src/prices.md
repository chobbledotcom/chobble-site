# Web development prices

I believe in transparent pricing for all jobs - my flat rate is **£200 per hour** (charged in half-hour increments), and initial consultations are free. I will tell you exactly what you'll get for each hour worked.

That rate is **discounted 50%** at **£100 per hour** for:

- 🌍 Charities and co-operatives
- 🎸 Musicians, artists, and writers
- 💚 Vegan businesses
- 🌞 Renewable energy businesses

## Service charges (static sites)

You can host up to 20 static websites with me for **£40** per month, or **£20 if discounted**. For this charge I will:

- **Host your websites** and monitor their uptime
- **Back up your sites** with Git, mirrored to two hosts
- **Provide support** when you have questions about editing your site
- Make any **quick changes** to your site, at your request
- Provide **free online marketing advice** via my [Patreon page](/services/patreon/)

You may choose to host elsewhere since you will have the full source code - that's totally fine. I recommend and support [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Neocities](https://neocities.org) and [Surge](https://surge.sh) but I will help you host wherever you like.

## Service charges (dynamic sites)

I will host your Ruby on Rails dynamic site on its own server running NixOS. I will use the most affordable and suitable VPS server available, starting at around £5 per month.

I will charge **£60** per month (or **£30 if discounted**) on top of whatever that hosting cost is. You will have full access to the server and its configuration. For this price we will:

- **Host your service** and monitor its uptime
- **Back up your code** via Git, mirrored to two hosts
- **Back up your database every day** and email the backup to you
- Make any **quick changes** to your system, at your request
- Provide **free online marketing advice** via my [Patreon page](/services/patreon/)

You can also host the Ruby site yourself, as you will have the full source code. I am happy to help you get set up on any host.

## Emails & domain renewals

I will help you source the ideal provider for your needs and budget. You will register and pay them directly, unless you _really_ don't want to, in which case we can sort something out.

I use [Purelymail](https://purelymail.com) for my own email hosting - they're very affordable and flexible. I can help you connect any email provider to your domain, and I'll run deliverability tests to make sure your emails get through.

## Other open source software

If you want to host [Nextcloud](/services/de-googling/) for shared documents for your team, or a Mastodon server for your club, or you need advice about any other "Free and Open Source Software" - I can help. And if you want to manage the server yourself and use me as a local consultant, that's totally fine.

## Prestwich businesses

If you're local to Prestwich and want me to visit your premises to help you with a technical issue, I'm happy to do so - but we'll need to make sure the job is well specced first. We should meet over a coffee first to describe the job in as much detail as we can.

## Take my money!

I take 50% of the total fee before starting working, with the other 50% due on completion. I'll send you a link to pay by card - I don't take cheques or cash.

**If this all sounds fair, [contact me](/contact/) and we'll get things moving!**
