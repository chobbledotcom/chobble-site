# Web Development Prices

I believe in transparent pricing for all jobs - my flat rate is **£200 per hour** (charged in half-hour increments), and discussions before and after the job are free. I will tell you exactly what you'll get for each hour worked.

That rate is **discounted 50%** at **£100 per hour** for:

- 🌍 Charities and co-operatives
- 🎸 Musicians, artists, and writers
- 💚 Vegan businesses
- 🌞 Renewable energy businesses

## Service charges (static sites)

You can host up to 20 static websites with me for **£40** per month, or **£20 if discounted**. For this charge I will:

- **Host your websites** and monitor their uptime
- **Back up your sites** with Git, mirrored to two hosts
- **Provide support** when you have questions about editing your site
- Make any **quick changes** to your site, at your request
- **Fix any bugs** that you or I spot.
- Provide **free online marketing advice** via my [Patreon page](/services/patreon/)

You may choose to host elsewhere since you will have the full source code - that's totally fine. I recommend and support [Netlify](https://netlify.com), [Neocities](https://neocities.org), [Bunny.net](https://bunny.net/), [Pico.sh](https://pico.sh/pgs), and [Surge](https://surge.sh) - but I will help you host wherever you like.

## Service charges (unmanaged sites)

If you're not planning on updating your site very often, want to pay someone else to update it, or want to handle all changes yourself, my "unmanaged" hosting package is **£10** per month or **£5** if discounted. For this I will:

- **Host and back up** ONE static website.
- **Fix any bugs** that you or I spot.

You won't get access to the Patreon group or any free changes included - but you can edit your site yourself, or pay me or my brother Kevin at [KevinBurkeServices.com](https://kevinburkeservices.com) for content changes ad-hoc.

## Service charges (dynamic sites)

I will host your Ruby on Rails dynamic site on its own server running NixOS. I will use the most affordable and suitable VPS server available, starting at around £5 per month.

I will charge **£60** per month (or **£30 if discounted**) on top of whatever that hosting cost is. You will have full access to the server and its configuration. For this price we will:

- **Host your service** and monitor its uptime
- **Back up your code** via Git, mirrored to two hosts
- **Back up your database every day** and email the backup to you
- Make any **quick changes** to your system, at your request
- Provide **free online marketing advice** via my [Patreon page](/services/patreon/)

You can also host the Ruby site yourself, as you will have the full source code. I am happy to help you get set up on any host.

## Emails & domain renewals

I will help you source the ideal provider for your needs and budget. You will register and pay them directly, unless you _really_ don't want to, in which case we can sort something out.

I use [Purelymail](https://purelymail.com) for my own email hosting - they're very affordable and flexible. I can help you connect any email provider to your domain, and I'll run deliverability tests to make sure your emails get through.

## Other open source software

If you want to host [Nextcloud](/services/de-googling/) for shared documents for your team, or a Mastodon server for your club, or you need advice about any other "Free and Open Source Software" - I can help. And if you want to manage the server yourself and use me as a local consultant, that's totally fine.

## Prestwich businesses

If you're local to Prestwich and want me to visit your premises to help you with a technical issue, I'm happy to do so - but we'll need to make sure the job is well specced first. We should meet over a coffee first to describe the job in as much detail as we can.

## Take my money!

I take 50% of the total fee before starting working, with the other 50% due on completion. I'll send you a link to pay by card - I don't take cheques or cash.

**If this all sounds fair, [contact me](/contact/) and we'll get things moving!**
