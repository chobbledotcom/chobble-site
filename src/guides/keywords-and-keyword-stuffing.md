# Keywords & Keyword Stuffing

The whole point of your website is to attract customers – but how do search engines decide who finds you? This guide should demystify "keywords" while helping you avoid "keyword stuffing", an outdated and ineffective tactic.

**Rather watch a video on this topic? [Click here to watch it](/videos/keywords-and-keyword-stuffing/).**

**I'll use a fictional example of a "widget / doodah / wotzit hire" company based in North Manchester, but the details apply to any business.**

---

## 1. What are keywords?

Keywords are the words and phrases people type into search engines like Google when they're looking for a product, service, or answer. Think of them as "search shortcuts" that connect what your customers need to what your business offers.

Potential customers of my widget hire company might search for things like:

- _"widget hire near me"_
- _"rent a widget in Prestwich"_
- _"same-day doodah delivery Whitefield"_
- _"cheap wotzit hire Manchester"_

### Why keywords matter

- **For search engines**: Keywords help people find you quickly. If your website uses the terms _they_ use, search engines are more likely to show you when they search for those words.
- **For visitors**: Visitors to your site who read your content will see that it addresses the term they searched for, making them more likely to contact you.

## 2. What is "keyword stuffing"?

Keyword stuffing is the outdated practice of cramming your content with excessive or unnatural keywords to trick search engines. For example, writing _"Looking for widget hire in Manchester? Our Manchester widget hire services offer cheap widget hire deals across Manchester"_. Repeating terms like _"widget hire"_ not only frustrates readers but signals to Google that your content is spammy, which risks penalising your site in search results - and even if you're not penalised, this content isn't helping you.

[Google lists "Keyword stuffing" as a type of spam on their "Spam policies" page](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies) and says _"to be eligble to appear in Google web search results, content shouldn't violate Google Search's overall policies or the spam policies listed on this page"_.

In the past, SEO strategies revolved around _"keyword density"_, a formula dictating how often a keyword should appear on a page. Today, this approach backfires. Google's algorithms prioritize **useful content** over robotic repetition. Instead of tallying keywords, they assess:

1. **Topic Depth**: Does your page answer all questions a customer might have? A widget hire page should cover pricing, delivery areas, FAQs, and use cases—not just repeat _"widget hire"_.
2. **Natural Flow**: Does the content sound human? Compare _"Our widget hire services in Prestwich offer Manchester widget hire at widget hire rates"_ (awkward) with _"We provide same-day widget delivery across Manchester, including Prestwich and Whitefield."_
3. **User Engagement**: If visitors "bounce" back to search results quickly, Google measures this and assumes your content doesn't meet their needs. Keyword-stuffed pages often fail to hold attention because they prioritize SEO jargon over clear answers.

**How to avoid stuffing**:

- Replace overused terms with synonyms (_"widgets for parties"_, _"widget delivery company"_, _"widgeteer"_, instead of _"widget hire"_ over and over).
- Use local phrases naturally: _"serving North Manchester"_ vs. _"Manchester widget hire Manchester"_.
- Read sentences aloud. If they sound forced, simplify! For instance, _"Affordable rates for weekend events"_ is clearer than _"Widget hire Manchester affordable widget hire for events."_

By focusing on **user intent** and **natural language**, you align with modern SEO best practices—and keep customers engaged.

## 3. User intent: What are potential customers really searching for?

User intent means _what your customers actually want_ when they type a search into Google. It's not just about the words they use – it's about the goal behind their search. Get this right, and your website becomes the answer they're looking for. Get it wrong, and you'll attract clicks that go nowhere.

**Interested in targeting specific, longer search phrases? [Click here to watch my video on long tail keywords](/videos/long-tail-keywords/).**

There are three main types of searches:

1. **"I want to buy NOW"** (Want the services you offer):

   - _Examples_: "urgent widget hire Prestwich", "same-day doodah delivery Manchester", "rent wotzits today".
   - **Your job**: Make booking/pricing clear and easy.

2. **"How much does it cost?"** (Wants to learn more):

   - _Examples_: "widget hire costs", "cheap doodah hire near me".
   - **Your job**: Add transparent pricing guides or "from £X per day" hints.

3. **"What's the best option?"** (Wants to compare options):
   - _Examples_: "best widget hire in Whitefield", "dongles vs wotzits".
   - **Your job**: Provide comparison guides or customer reviews.

**Example for your business**:

If you notice your customers frequently ask, _"Do you deliver to events on weekends?"_, their intent isn't just to find a widget hire company – it's to confirm logistics. Your content should answer this directly:

> _"We offer weekend delivery for events across Manchester, including Prestwich and Whitefield. Book by 3pm for next-day service."_

**How to Find User Intent**:

- **Google's "People Also Ask"**: Type your keyword (e.g., _"widget hire Manchester"_) into Google. The drop-down questions (e.g., _"How long can I hire widgets for?"_) reveal related intents.
- **Listen to your customers**: What questions do they ask? (e.g., _"Are deposits refundable?"_)

---

## 4. Semantically-related words

Semantically related words are phrases or terms that _connect_ to your main keyword, either as synonyms (like "dongles" for widgets) or contextually linked ideas (like "event supplies" or "party equipment").

- **Search engines** use them to understand context. If your page mentions "widget hire", "dongle repairs", and "wotzit storage", Google knows your business covers the full lifecycle of these products.
- **Visitors** get a clearer picture of your services without its text feeling repetitive.

So, instead of repeating _"widget hire in Manchester"_ ten times, try:

> _"We offer affordable widget hire across Manchester, including same-day doodah delivery for events. Need long-term wotzit hire or repairs? Our Whitefield team has you covered."_

**Warning**: If your local customers _don't_ use certain terms, avoid them! Google is clever enough to figure out what your site is about in any case. For example, British customers are unlikely to search for _"widget rental"_, and more likely to search _"widget hire"_ - so don't try and squeeze "rental" in just to appease Google.

**Avoid**:

- Forcing in synonyms just for SEO (e.g., _"Our Manchester widget hire doodahs for wotzits..."_).
- Using jargon that confuses customers.

## 5. Headers (H1, H2, H3 Tags)

Headers act like signposts for both visitors and search engines. Just like chapter titles in a book, they break up walls of text, making it easier for visitors to scan your content and understand what each section covers. Your H1 tag is your **main page title** – every page should have just one. Think of it as the bold headline on a shop front. A vague H1 like _"Services"_ doesn't say much, but _"Affordable Widget Hire in Prestwich & Manchester"_ instantly tells Google and visitors exactly what you offer.

H2 tags split your content into clear sections. For example, _"Why Choose Our Whitefield Doodah Hire?"_ or _"Same-Day Widget Delivery in Manchester"_ keep the focus local without repeating "widget hire" endlessly. Switch "widget" for synonyms like _"dongle delivery"_ to keep things fresh. H3s dive deeper under those H2s, like adding _"Our Prestwich Hire Process in 3 Simple Steps"_ under a broader _"How Widget Hire Works"_ section.

Honestly – most pages won't need H3s, unless they are really long. Don't force them in just for SEO's sake.

**Check before saving**: Do your headers guide readers naturally? Have you woven in locations like Prestwich? Is the language human-friendly or stuffed with jargon?

### 6. Meta descriptions – Your site's "shop window" in search results

A meta description is the short blurb that appears under your website link in search engine results. Think of it as your **digital shop window** – a split-second chance to convince searchers to click your link over rivals. While Google might replace yours with a more relevant page snippet if they think it matches the searcher's intent better, you still need to craft a compelling meta description. Why? Because if Google _does_ show yours, a clear, benefit-packed one can **boost your click-through rate even if you're not ranking first**.

**Crucially**, your meta description must **answer the searcher's intent**. If someone types _"widget hire Prestwich"_, a vague _"We provide widgets. Contact us for more info"_ won't cut it. Instead, try: _"Need widget hire in Prestwich? We're local experts offering flexible hire, 24/7 support, and same-day delivery. Book online today!"_ – clear, keyword-aware, and action-focused.

For formatting, **keep it under 150 characters** (use a [character counter](https://charactercounttool.com/) to check), and work in your keyword naturally once, like _"widget hire in Manchester"_. Mention a location (Prestwich, Whitefield, or Manchester) to attract locals and highlight benefits – urgency (_"same-day"_), ease (_"no deposit"_), or USPs like live booking.

**Key dos and don'ts**: Focus on your strongest reason to choose you (e.g., _"serving Prestwich since 2020"_), include delivery areas, and avoid keyword spam (_"widget hire widget hire Manchester"_). Never reuse the same meta description across pages – each should reflect the page's unique focus.

Your meta description is free advertising in search results. Make it impossible to scroll past!

## 7. Images & "alt tags": describe, don't stuff

Alt text (alternative text) is a short, factual description of an image that serves two key purposes. First, it helps visually impaired users "see" the image via screen readers. Second, it tells search engines what the image shows, boosting your SEO. For example, a photo of widgets at a corporate event might have alt text like _"Red widgets displayed at a Manchester corporate event"_ – descriptive and location-specific. Avoid keyword-stuffed nonsense like _"Cheap widget hire Manchester widgets for hire"_ or generic filenames like _"IMG_1234.jpg"_, which hurt both accessibility and SEO.

Why bother? Over [43 million people](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/blindness-and-visual-impairment) worldwide have visual impairments, and clear alt text ensures your site works for everyone. Plus, Google uses alt text to rank images in **Google Images**, so a well-described photo of _"Technician repairing a doodah in Whitefield"_ could bring in local customers.

When writing alt tags, **stick to the facts**. Describe what's actually in the image (_"Three blue widgets stacked at a Manchester park"_), not your opinion (_"Best widget hire in Manchester"_). Keep it short (under 125 characters) and include location or action details where relevant, like _"Heaton Park event setup with widgets"_ or _"Technician loading widgets into a van in Whitefield"_. Skip phrases like _"image of"_ – screen readers already announce it's an image. For decorative graphics (e.g., dividers), leave the alt text empty.

**BCN customers**: Your product images already have solid alt tags matching their names – nice!

**Before saving**, ask yourself: Does this alt text literally describe the image? Is it free of keyword spam? Would it make sense if the image didn't load?

## 8. How to Structure Content Effectively

Writing for humans means explaining your services as if you're chatting with a customer. Skip the jargon like _"Widget hire solutions for Manchester-based event facilitations"_ – it's vague and reads weirdly. Instead, aim for clarity: _"Need widgets for your Manchester event? We deliver same-day, with flexible pricing and no hidden fees."_ See the difference? One feels like a corporate brochure; the other solves a real problem.

Internal links act as signposts, guiding visitors to related parts of your site. For instance, if your blog post mentions the _"Top 5 Event Trends in Manchester"_, weave in a link like _"Need widgets for your event? Explore our Manchester Event Widget Hire Guide."_ Similarly, your homepage's product section could highlight _"One of our most popular hires: [blue widgets]."_

**Keep it natural**: Use descriptive phrases like _"Book Whitefield widget delivery here"_ instead of generic "Click here." And only link where it makes sense – forcing links into unrelated text confuses readers and search engines alike.

### Local SEO

A smart way to boost local SEO is by **naming nearby landmarks** in your content. For example, saying you're "minutes from the Whitefield Metrolink station" or "serving events near Heaton Park" helps customers – and Google – link your services to specific areas. This matches real searches like _"widget hire near Heaton Park"_, putting you front-of-mind for local needs.

For businesses covering multiple areas, **dedicated location pages** work wonders. Create a page titled _"Manchester Widget Hire for Events & Businesses"_ and another for _"Same-Day Widget Hire in Prestwich"_. These let you target location-specific searches without your pages competing for the same keywords. On each page, include an address map, local testimonials (like _"Stefan delivered really quickly to our Prestwich office!"_), and unique perks for that area, such as free overnight hires for Whitefield customers.

⚠️ **Important**: Never copy-paste the same content and just swap "Manchester" for "Prestwich"! Google penalises duplicate content, so keep each page fresh:

- Manchester Page: _"Our Manchester team offers [specific service] with [unique perk, e.g., weekend availability]."_
- Prestwich Page: _"Serving Prestwich clients with [different perk, e.g., free same-day setup]."_

### 9. Using AI to analyse your content

If you're not a confident writer, a great approach for ensuring your content reads well is to ask AI to analyse it. Here's an example prompt you can use:

> "Here is a page I wrote for my website about widget hire in Prestwich. Evaluate its content from a potential customer's point of view and tell me how it could be improved. Highlight any spelling and grammar mistakes (using British English). Tell me about any unnatural repetition or keyword stuffing. Just tell me the fixes - do not re-write the document. I will paste the text in my next message."

I just tested this exact prompt on a very keyword-stuffed, AI-generated page I found online, and got some excellent feedback.

I advise against using any tools specifically designed to analyse "keyword density" - this approach is outdated and might encourage you to write unnatural-sounding text. It's much better to focus on a potential customer's point of view.

## 10. "This feels like a lot of work - my site has 150 pages!"

Like every other job to do with your website, it's important to think of refining its content as a long-term job. There's no need to go and change every single page of your website today. Instead, start with the most high priority pages - your homepage and your most popular product or service, for example.

Set some time aside every now and again to tweak the pages on your site, working through them in priority order. Trying to fix everything all at once will just overwhelm you - it's much easier to steadily improve it.

A bonus to gradual, constant improvement is that Google likes sites that were recently updated. Thinking of your content as a "once and done" process means you miss out on the "recently updated" search engine rankings boost!

## 11. Conclusion

I hope the main takeaway you've got from reading this document is to **write for humans first and foremost.** Search engines are excellent at determining whether content is focused on human visitors or manipulates SEO, and **they much prefer content that is useful for humans**.

With that in mind, there are still some ways you can make your site more useful to search engines too, without compromising on the readability for humans:

- Think about **customer intent** and write content to address it
- **Mix up** your keywords to stop your text sounding repetitive
- **Break up** long pages with headings and sub-headings
