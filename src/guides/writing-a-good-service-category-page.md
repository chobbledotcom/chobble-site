# Writing a Good Service / Product / Category Page

Service / product / category pages should answer one question in a bunch of different ways:

**"For this product / service / category specifically, why should the visitor choose your business over someone else?"**

**Need a quick lesson on avoiding waffle? [Click here to watch my video on being concise](/videos/be-concise/).**

To save me writing out that question over and over in this document, I'm just going to refer to it as _The Why Question_. I'm also going to refer to "product pages", but these might be pages for services or product categories too - the same approach works in all cases.

Your aim should be to answer _The Why Question_ as comprehensively as you possibly can (after all, there's probably a whole bunch of reasons why they should choose you, right?) while also getting to the point efficiently so visitors don't have to _work_ to find the specific answer to _The Why Question_ which will convince them.

## Types of mistake

When product pages don't answer _The Why Question_ effectively, it's usually because they're either:

1. **Too brief** with barely any content.
2. **Huge** with walls of text that would take ages to read.
3. **Keyword-stuffed** and obscure the answer.
4. **AI-generated generic text** that could describe _any_ business, not _yours specifically_.

Lets dig into each of those a bit:

### Problem #1: Too-brief pages

If a friend asked you to tell them about one of your products, I wager you'd be able to talk about it at some length - how your business deals with it, what questions come up regularly, what kind of clients you'd like to attract for it, why you're a good choice of provider for it, and so on. You would have no problem answering _The Why Question_, because you (presumably!) take pride in knowing all about it and providing a quality service.

By missing this information from your product pages you're forcing the visitor to either search around on the site for it, get in touch with you to ask questions, or - worst of all - just go somewhere else where that information is readily available.

### Problem #2: Huge pages

You might be tempted to address every single question the customer might have on the page, ending up with a really long page of text which would take minutes for a visitor to read. Many of these questions won't be specific to the product you're discussing - for example, you might list every single service area you cover.

Pages like this can overwhelm the visitor and bury the key bit of information they're looking for to convince them to choose you.

You can break these pages up with sub-headings (which I'll discuss later), but you may also want to **move the more "general" information to dedicated pages**, and link to those pages with a quick summary from your product pages instead.

This means that a paragraph like:

> "We hire widgets in Altrincham (£20), Blackley (free), Bolton (£20), Broughton (free), Cheetham Hill (free), Clifton (free), Crumpsall (free), Denton (£10), Droylsden (£10), Heaton Park (free), Middleton (free), Prestwich (free), Radcliffe (free), Ramsbottom (£10), Sale (£20), Salford (free), Simister (free), Swinton (£10), Unsworth (free), Westhoughton (£20), Whitefield (free), etc etc etc"

Can become the much easier to understand:

> "We hire widgets anywhere within 20 miles of our Prestwich base, with free delivery within 10 miles. [Click here for our full list of delivery areas and prices].

### Problem #2: Keyword-stuffed pages

Keyword stuffed pages use the same words or phrases too often. This is done in an attempt to boost search rankings, but it makes the text sound unnatural and obscures the answers to _The Why Question_.

Neither search engines or your potential customers like this practice - it was an effective search engine technique back in 2010, but nowadays Google doesn't analyse how many times a keyword appears on your page. Instead, they look for evidence that your page addresses the customer's "intent", and for product pages that means evidence that it answers _The Why Question_.

**There's a guide all about "Keywords & Keyword Stuffing" in the [guides section](/guides/).**

### Problem #3: AI Waffle

When using AI to help write your pages, it's important to remember that **AI will never create new information**. They work by scraping the internet for existing information, and then re-formatting it to answer your prompts.

This means that AI chatbots can sometimes use a lot of words to say very little. The text often uses vague, cliched, or generic phrases that do not help the reader answer _The Why Question_. They tend towards writing in American English, with different spelling and word choices than we use in the UK.

This means you cannot rely on AI to answer _The Why Question_ succinctly without spending some time providing it with the answers to the question. You should also aim to spend at least 10x as much time tweaking the AI response to suit your business as you spent prompting it. You should use AI as a writing partner or editor, rather than as the author.

Rather than prompting AI with "write a page about widget hire", instead you might want to prompt with something like:

> "I am writing a page on my website about widget hire in Prestwich. I want to emphasise the reasons someone should choose my business for their widget hire needs. I have been hiring widgets for 15 years. I am WDGT-qualified and my widgets are examined every two years by a WIDJ-qualified inspector. I have a 9.9/10 rating on the Checkawidget website. I have over 150 reviews on my Google Business listing, with a 4.8 rating. I am based in Prestwich and deliver within 20 miles. Use British English in your response."

Or even better - **write the page yourself first**, and then pass it onto the AI with a prompt like:

> "Here is a page I wrote about widget hire in Prestwich. Tell me if I have missed any important information, or could write things in a more concise way. Tell me if there are any spelling or grammatical mistakes, or if any sentences are hard to read."

**Check out the guide about using AI effectively in the [guides section](/guides/).**

## Personality

Given all of the above, you might be tempted to write your pages in the most hyper-efficient way possible with no filler or cruft, just straight facts. While this might work well for some "business to business" industries, if you're dealing with the general public then your personality matters - it's one of the factors that make up part of _The Why Question_.

You don't have to go overboard with this - don't feel obliged to write in a heavy regional dialect, or to squeeze jokes in, or write anything overly-personal, but if you want your text to sound friendly you may want to **write as though you are speaking the words**, by doing things like:

**Use less formal phrases and simple language.** Rather than saying _"Our team strives to ensure your complete satisfaction when hiring our widgets"_, you might say _"We want you to be totally happy with our widget hire service"_.

**Include anecdotes when relevant.** You might mention your personal experiences or preferences, or those of your friends and family. For example, you could say _"This widget was the star attraction at my son's 4th birthday party"_, or _"This widget is our team's favourite - they love seeing the reactions on customers' faces when we set it to max speed"_.

**Use contractions.** Tweaks as simple as writing _"that's"_ rather than _"that is"_ can make a big difference to how formal and natural your content sounds. Compare _"That is why we are sure we are the best"_ to _"That's why we're sure we're the best"._

## Breaking text up

Many visitors won't read all of the text on a page. Instead, they'll scan the text to try and find the specific answer to _The Why Question_ they need. You can make this process easier by breaking the text up and making it more visually interesting, by doing things like:

**Using sub-headers.** You can split the text up into logical sections using H2 header tags. For example, if your text contains a bunch of points to do with safety, it would be worth putting these under a _"Safety"_ header. Doing this would mean that searchers who are mostly interested in your safety credentials can easily spot that header and jump straight to the bit they care about.

**Using formatting.** You may notice that this document has some key bits in **bold**, with the occasional use of _italics_ for emphasis and quotes. It also includes links to other places - like my docs on keywords or AI. Adding features like this to your text can make it easier to read by highlighting the important words, or by indicating chunks of text as quotations.

## Examples

Given all of the above, here's an example product page for my widget hire category. The text in [square brackets] would link through to more specific pages:

> # Widget Hire in North Manchester

## Explaining the example

The example above tries to answer _The Why Question_ in its opening paragraph - _"you should choose us because we're experienced, we have relevant qualifications, and customers love us"_.

If the customer's _Why Question_ is more about the specifics of widget hire, rather than the company, the second section addresses this - _"our widgets are UK-manufactured, safe, and available for hire all year"_

The text is broken up with H2 sub-headings into clearly defined sections, making it easy to scan. It uses a friendly, conversational tone, and backs up its claims with proof, in the form of reviews from real customers. It includes lots of specific details about the business, with no filler text, and includes an anecdote about hiring to the "Festwich" Festival.

## Conclusion

I hope the above gives you plenty to think about when writing your product, category, or services pages. To wrap this up, I think it's worth repeating _The Why Question_ again. You should keep this question in mind throughout your work on these types of pages. Repeat it like a mantra in your head - it should be your guiding light.
