# Web Design & Technology Services

You can hire me to [build custom software](/services/software-developer/#content), make an [entirely new website](/services/static-websites/#content), improve an existing one, help you [set up a server](/services/technical-advice/#content), advise you about [search engine optimisation](/services/seo-audits/#content), get my input on a techy decision at your job, or maybe write [totally bespoke web applications](/services/ruby-on-rails-developer/#content) for you.

In any case you'll get the benefit of my decades of experience building and maintaining web software for businesses of all sizes, with a commitment to honesty and straightforwardness.

## My Principles

**Transparent:** I charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/) for all jobs. I will break down each job by hour so you know exactly what you're getting.

**Open source:** I'll give you full edit access to the code I write and explain how all it works - you'll _own_ your project rather than _renting_ access to it.

**Affordable:** I prefer low cost and widely-compatible tools over proprietary and locked-down systems. You can host anywhere - or pay me and get free marketing advice included.

**Accessible & performant:** I choose accessible systems which allow visually-impaired users to browse your site, and I make performant sites which are easy to use on all devices.

## Services
