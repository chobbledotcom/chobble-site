# Chobble's Principles

This business works to a set of straightforward principles:

- **Transparency:** No secrets are kept from customers. The software powering they rely on is theirs to keep.
- **Own, not rent:** Its income comes from building things and providing services - not from charging rent.
- **Fair prices:** Its prices are flat for all jobs and are set at the market rate for an experienced freelance programmer - with a 50% discount for charities, cooperatives, and artists.
- **Freedom:** Customers have full control of their data and can move it to any provider.

The goal of these principles is to **encourage customers to choose Chobble based on the quality of its work**. This might sound like a strange thing to have to spell out, but it's actually quite different from how many companies operate by:

- Locking you in with a contract
- Making it hard to move which holds your data hostage
- Ratcheting up the ongoing costs
- Taking a cut of your profits
- Providing the minimal level of service to not lose your custom

Chobble was founded to try and create a sustainable tech business that doesn't fall into any of these bad habits. And by writing these priciples out in public, I make it easier for customers and potential customers to hold me to them.

For a deep dive into the -isms behind Chobble, you might want to read the Wikipedia pages for [Utilitarianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) and [Anarchism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism).

## Who is Chobble?

Chobble is me, Stef, from Prestwich, Manchester ([here's my CV](https://www.stefn.co.uk/cv/)) - a [freelance software developer](/services/software-developer/) with over 20 years of experience working on websites of all sizes - from local charities like [Blue Pits](https://www.bluepitshousingaction.co.uk) and social groups like [Vegan Prestwich](https://veganprestwich.co.uk) to busy web applications like [Bouncy Castle Network](https://www.bouncycastlenetwork.com) and huge international storefronts like [Bandcamp.com](https://bandcamp.com).

After years of working in other companies I decided to fully commit to freelancing, and started Chobble to:

- Build websites and tools for local organisations and individuals
- Provide honest advice and guidance
- Contribute to the wider open source community

## Transparent & flexible

I charge a [flat per-hour rate](/prices/) for all web development services and tell you exactly what's included for each hour.

I prefer solutions which empower their users and so prioritise open source tools and flexibility over proprietary or locked-in solutions. You should be able to import and export data easily.

I do not force you to host on my server, and I provide instructions for hosting elsewhere or moving away - although you might like to host with me anyway.

I am happy to explain as much about how your website works as you like, and will share all source code by default - [here's my source repository](https://git.chobble.com).

I know many other [tech-adjacent people](/friends/) (eg designers, copywriters, marketers) and are happy to connect you with them if you need their services.

## What does "Chobble" mean?

Either "to chew food", "to talk loudly" or "to calm down" - but really I just chose it because it's a fun word to say.
