# Linux Consultant in Manchester

I've been using Linux as my personal operating system, and for my servers, for years. If you need a Linux consultant in Greater Manchester, or remote advice anywhere in the world, get in touch - I can help you set up servers, manage your infrastructure, lower your costs, and automate repetitive jobs.

## Flat prices

I charge a [flat fee for all jobs](/prices/) - £200 per hour, or £100 if discounted for charities, coops, artists, and sustainable businesses. Discussions around the job are free.

## Web hosting & infrastructure

I can deploy your web application or static site, set up domains, backups, and monitoring, and keep everything running smoothly. I help organisations self-host their tools - file sharing, media libraries, or automation systems - on hardware they control, whether that's in-house or in a datacentre somewhere.

## Backups and security

We can get you set up with a private, secure network so your team members can access your internal tools remotely. We can create on-site or off-site backups for your business critical information, including to S3 with mandatory retention policies.

## Hardware & automation

I can help you spec and build open source hardware solutions for things like security, monitoring, networking, or anything else. There's usually an open source, community-driven alternative to proprietary and expensive server software.

## Troubleshooting & development

I can debug Linux problems, fix performance issues, and help recover broken systems. I can help you build reproducible development setups, build systems, and deployment pipelines.
