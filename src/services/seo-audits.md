# SEO Audits

With decades of experience helping sites rank well on Google, I know what works and what is a waste of effort.

I have worked for businesses of all sizes, from fresh startups with zero sales through to huge international ecommerce sites processing hundreds of millions of pounds in sales every year.

I can do an SEO audit of your existing website and give you a list of tasks to help improve your rankings and attract more visitors.

Like all of my services, I charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/) and will tell you exactly what we I do for that hour. You can choose to employ as much or as little of my services as you like.

## Full Site SEO Audits

The services I can offer as **full site** audit could include:

- **1 hour: Automated scan of your site** ([Buy with Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/bIYfZxd3i4OUd8caEG))
  - I'll use [Screamingfrog's SEO Spider tool](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/) to produce a report from your site.
- **+1 hour: Prioritising the scan output** ([Buy with Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/7sI8x50gw5SYecg9AD))
  - I'll formatting the raw scan output into prioritised items in easily understood, jargon-free language so you will know what needs doing most urgently.
- **1 hour: Backlink profile analysis** ([Buy with Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/7sI4gPfbqdlq2tyaEI))
  - I'll analyse the backlink profile of a website (maybe your competitor's?) and grade the quality of their links, to give you insight into places worth building links for your business. For more on this topic, see my [guide to finding backlinks](/guides/backlinks/).

## Single Keyword SEO Audits

I can also do specific **keyword audits** to help you improve your ranking for a specific term:

- **1 hour: Evaluating existing content** ([Buy with Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/cN25kTgfugxCb044gl))
  - I will read your existing page and give jargon-free instructions on how to improve its quality and relevance, which should boost it up search results. Common issues include [keyword stuffing](/guides/keywords-and-keyword-stuffing/) and poor structure.
- **2 hours: Evaluating your competition** ([Buy with Stripe](https://buy.stripe.com/00g8x56EUa9e3xCcMS))
  - I will compare your site's performance for a given keyword to your competitor's, and explain where your site is falling short.

## Ethics and Honesty

If your site doesn't need any improvements I will tell you - and you won't be charged.

I do not guarantee improvements to search engine rankings and you should not trust anyone who does, but I know what works and have a long track record of success.

I will never prioritise one customer over another - everyone pays the same [flat hourly fee](/prices/) and gets the same high quality of service.

**If this sounds like a good fit for your website, please [contact me](/contact/) and we can get the ball rolling!**

**Performance note:** Google - and potential customers - prefer websites that load quickly, and [performant sites generate more sales (article by Cloudflare)](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/). With this in mind, you should make sure your site performs well on [Google's Lighthouse tester tool](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview#devtools) which is built into every Chrome desktop browser and gives suggestions for improving site performance. If your site is _really_ slow, it will hold any other SEO efforts back.

If you need help interpreting Lighthouse results or implementing fixes, I can help - I've worked on loads of performance-related fixes in my years.
