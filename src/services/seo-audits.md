# Search Engine Optimisation Audits

With decades of experience helping sites rank well on Google, I know what works and what is a waste of effort.

I have worked for businesses of all sizes, from fresh startups with zero sales through to huge international ecommerce sites processing hundreds of millions of pounds in sales every year.

I can do an SEO audit of your existing website and give you a list of tasks to help improve your rankings and attract more visitors.

Like all of my services, I charge a [flat hourly rate](/prices/) and will tell you exactly what we I do for that hour. You can choose to employ as much or as little of my services as you like.

## Full Site SEO Audits

The services I can offer as **full site** audit could include:

- **1 hour: Automated scan of your site**
  - I'll use [Screamingfrog's SEO Spider tool](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/) to produce a report from your site.
- **1 hour: Prioritising the scan output**
  - I'll formatting the raw scan output into prioritised items in easily understood, jargon-free language so you will know what needs doing most urgently.
- **1 hour: Backlink profile analysis**
  - I'll analyse the backlink profile of a website (maybe your competitor's?) and grade the quality of their links, to give you insight into places worth building links for your business.

## Single Keyword SEO Audits

I can also do specific **keyword audits** to help you improve your ranking for a specific term:

- **1 hour: Evaluating existing content**
  - I will read your existing page and give jargon-free instructions on how to improve its quality and relevance, which should boost it up search results.
- **2 hours: Evaluating your competition**
  - I will compare your site's performance for a given keyword to your competitor's, and explain where your site is falling short.

## Page Performance Audits

Both Google and potential customers like it when your site loads quickly, and [performant sites generate more sales](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/more/website-performance-conversion-rates/).

I can evaluate your site's performance using [Google's Lighthouse tool](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_(software)>) to discover ways you (or your website provider) can make your site faster and improve its conversion rate:

- **2 hours: Lighthouse evaluation**
  - I will scan your site with Lighthouse and explain the results in jargon-free language, for you or your provider to fix.
- **1 - 24 hours: Performance fixes**
  - If you have access to your site's source code we can _probably_ fix performance issues ourselves. I have decades of experience in making sites load quickly - even really complex ones.

## Ethics and Honesty

If your site does not need any improvements, I will tell you - and you won't be charged.

I do not guarantee improvements to search engine rankings and you should not trust anyone who does, but I know what works and have a long track record of success.

I will never prioritise one customer over another - everyone pays the same [flat hourly fee](/prices/) and gets the same high quality of service.

If this sounds like a good fit for your website, please [contact me](/contact/) and we can get the ball rolling!
