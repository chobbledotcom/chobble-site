# Framework Laptop Builds in Prestwich, Manchester

As a lifelong nerd I've build dozens of computers over the years and repaired just as many. It's much cheaper to build and repair your own PC than to buy something "off the shelf" with an expensive maintenance contract.

This is often difficult to accomplish with laptops - they sometimes have soldered or glued-in parts that are hard to replace, cables and connectors that are easy to break, and screens that require major surgery to replace.

This results in huge amounts of "e-waste" as laptops are sent to landfill just because one component has broken.

**Framework ([frame.work](https://frame.work)) have created a solution all of this, by building easily repaired, upgraded, and customisable laptops and selling spare parts at affordable prices.**

## I can help you build your own laptop

If you're local to Prestwich or Manchester and are considering a new laptop for yourself or your business, consider getting a Framework one, in "DIY" version.

This will arrive as an unassembled kit, and you'll need to fit your own memory and hard drive, and install your own operating system.

**I can help you with all of this.** It's nothing too complicated and there are loads of tutorials online, but having someone sat next to you who has built loads of computers might help.

## Why build my own?

**You'll save money.** By building your own laptop you can choose memory and hard drive options from any retailer. You can monitor deal websites and save hundreds of pounds!

**You'll see that it's easy.** We'll open your laptop and install the new drives using the screwdriver Framework provide. This is the same process you'd need to do for upgrades or repairs!

**It's fun!** It's like Lego, and you'll learn a bit about how your computer works as we go.

## Customised Laptops in Prestwich

Framework laptops are **fully customisable**. Never mind just the screen size or processor - you can even pick your ports (USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, Ethernet, MicroSD, etc.) and swap them as needed. Choose your colours - bezels come in black, grey, orange, green, purple, or transparent.

I'll install **Ubuntu Linux** (easy), **NixOS** (advanced), or **Windows** (boo!). Framework offer options from basic durable builds for students or kids, to high end setups for development work or mobile gaming. We can sit down together in Prestwich and browse the Framework store to assemble the exact laptop you need.

## Framework Laptops for Business Fleets

For businesses in Manchester, Framework laptops make more sense than Dell or HP contracts. Keep a small stock of Framework parts (screens, keyboards, batteries, mainboards) and your IT team can do repairs in-house in minutes instead of shipping laptops away for weeks. A broken screen costs £179 to fix yourself versus £500+ through Dell ProSupport. Standardise on one Framework model across your fleet and you can swap components between machines - dead laptop becomes spare parts. No more extended warranties, no more waiting for technicians, no more writing off perfectly good machines because one component failed. I can help set up your initial fleet and train your team on repairs.
