# Restaurant Web Design

**Running a restaurant is hard enough without your website giving you grief.** You need something that shows your menu, hours and location as straightforwardly as possible. This means cutting back on the animations, heavy graphics, and PDFs that won't open on phones - making it as easy as poss for hungry customers to find what they need.

My [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/#content) provides the framework for a really solid restaurant website. Your menus will be real web pages that load instantly, not PDF downloads. The whole site is really fast loading, and when you need to change a price or add a dish, you can do it yourself in seconds.

**And if you run a vegan restaurant, you'll get 50% off** - that's just **£300** for a basic website. Vegetarian places with good vegan options might get a discount too - just ask when you get in touch.

## Why choose my websites?

Many restaurant websites are messy. They hide menus in PDF downloads that won't open on phones. They use heavy frameworks that take ages to load. And if they're hard to update they might have outdated menus or even worse, opening times!

But when you use my template and need to update prices or dishes, it takes seconds - no waiting for your web developer. Your phone number, address and opening hours are right there where people expect them, and updated in one spot. And since most people are searching on their phones these days, that's exactly what I design for.

## Real restaurant / cafe websites in action

<div class="examples">

- ![This & That homepage, showing "Home", "Menu", and a photo of the alley where the This & That Indian cafe is hidden away](/assets/examples/this-and-that.png) **[This & That Cafe](/examples/this-and-that/#content)** - Manchester's legendary curry cafe gets thousands of visitors every week. Their simple, fast-loading site puts the menu first and ranks #1 for countless local search terms.
- ![Sally's Bakes homepage with colourful design and vegan pastries](/assets/examples/sallys-bakes.png) **[Sally's Bakes](/examples/sallys-bakes/#content)** - This vegan bakery in Bury showcases full ingredient lists and allergen info. They rank #1 on Google for "vegan bakery Bury" and similar searches.
- ![Avo Coffee homepage showing clean navigation and cafe photo](/assets/examples/avo-coffee.png) **[Avo Coffee](/examples/avo-coffee/#content)** - A Haslingden cafe with instant page loads and crystal-clear menu presentation. Built on my template, with easy self-service updates.

## Simple menu updates

The biggest headache with restaurant websites? Keeping menus current. With my system:

1. Click your edit bookmark
2. Log in with your email
3. Update any menu item in a simple text editor
4. Click save - changes go live after about a minute

You're in complete control using [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org) - and I'm always just a WhatsApp conversation away if you need help.

## Built for SEO

Restaurants live and die by local search results. My sites are engineered to rank well. Google loves fast-loading sites, so mine are lightning quick. They're properly optimised for mobile, which is essential for local searches. I use structured data (JSON-LD) to help Google understand your menu and hours. Everything's optimised for those "food near me" searches that bring in customers.

And if you pay for hosting and support from me, you'll get one-on-one help to implement strategies from my [free marketing guides](/guides/#content) and [videos](/videos/#content) to climb those search rankings.

## Transparent restaurant website pricing

A professional restaurant website from me starts at **£600** - [check out my price calculator](/price-calculator/#content). That gets you a mobile-first responsive design with a complete menu system, easy self-service editing, a contact form with spam protection, Google Maps integration, initial SEO setup, and proper training on how to update everything yourself.

**Vegan restaurants get 50% off** - so just £300 for the same package.

Hosting is just **£10/month** for simple sites, or **£40/month** with ongoing support, updates, and marketing advice. I advise using the "with support" package initially until you're totally comfortable editing your new site.

## What the Chobble Template gives your restaurant

My restaurant websites are built on my own [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/), which has been refined over years of building sites for Manchester businesses. The template is the foundation, but I can customise anything you need - it's dead easy to override bits or add new features.

The menu system is clever, if I do say so myself. You can have multiple menus - breakfast, lunch, dinner, drinks, whatever you need. Each menu item shows the name, price and description, plus dietary info with little symbols for vegan, gluten-free, halal and anything else. The menus are organised into categories like starters, mains and puddings. And with PagesCMS, you just click edit, change what you want in a simple form, and save - you don't have to edit any code or anything technical.

For special events, there's a whole events system built in. Whether it's a one-off wine tasting or your regular quiz night every Tuesday, it all goes on the site. Each event can have its own Google Maps location, and customers can download calendar reminders for individual events so they don't forget.

The opening hours show up on every page, right in the footer where people expect them. All your social media links are there too - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp for bookings, Google Maps for directions. There's a proper contact form with spam protection that actually works. And you can showcase your best reviews and testimonials to build trust with new customers.

Photo galleries let you show off your best dishes and the atmosphere of your place. News posts keep regulars informed about specials and what's new. Everything loads instantly thanks to some clever tech under the hood, and it all works perfectly on phones where most of your customers are looking.

## Frequently asked questions

<details>
<summary><strong>How quickly can my site be ready?</strong></summary>

Most restaurant websites can be live within a week. If you have your menu, photos, and basic info ready, we can move even faster. Rush jobs are possible if you're opening soon.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about online ordering?</strong></summary>

I can integrate with existing platforms like Deliveroo or Uber Eats, no problemmo. For full custom ordering systems, we'd need to discuss a more complex build - but for most restaurants, integrating with established platforms works better and costs less.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I update the site from my phone?</strong></summary>

Yes! The editing system works on any device. I've updated this very website using the same editor, between sets at the gym.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I qualify for the vegan discount?</strong></summary>

If your restaurant is 100% vegan, you definitely qualify for 50% off. Vegetarian restaurants or those with substantial vegan menus may qualify for partial discounts - just ask when you get in touch.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I already have a website?</strong></summary>

I can migrate your existing content and improve what's not working. Many restaurants come to me after struggling with Wix, Squarespace, or outdated WordPress sites. The migration process is smooth and your site won't go down during the switch.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will you travel to photograph my restaurant?</strong></summary>

For Manchester-area restaurants, I'm happy to visit and take photos for an additional fee. Good photos make a huge difference to conversion rates, so this is often worth the investment. Or even better - I can recommend a local photographer for some pro pics.
