# Charity Web Development

**Charities get ripped off by web agencies who see "big organisation" and assume unlimited budgets** - I've seen quotes of £2500+ for basic websites that take 6-8 hours of actual work. I charge charities **£100 per hour** (50% off my standard rate) and tell you exactly what work is involved.

I've been working with charities and community organisations for over a decade - from registered housing charities like [Blue Pits](/examples/blue-pits/) to community groups like [Crumpsall Folk Club](/examples/crumpsall-folk-club/). I also host sites for [Freehold Cottage](https://freeholdcottage.com) and [Newbarn Ltd](https://newbarnltd.co.uk).

## Why charities need different tech

Most web agencies push expensive proprietary systems that lock you in - WordPress plugins that need constant updates, Wix subscriptions that keep increasing, custom CMSs that only they can maintain. **You end up paying forever for something that should have been simple.**

I use open source technology exclusively. This means:

- **You own the code** - take it to another developer anytime
- **No license fees** - the software is free, you just pay for the work
- **Community support** - thousands of developers contribute improvements
- **No vendor lock-in** - host anywhere, modify anything
- **Proven technology** - battle-tested by millions of organisations

Open source isn't just cheaper - it's better for charities because it aligns with your values of transparency and community benefit. The same way charities exist to help people rather than make profit, open source software exists to solve problems rather than extract rent.

## Completely transparent pricing

I charge **£100 per hour** for charity work (50% off my standard £200 rate). Here's what typical charity websites actually cost:

**Basic charity website (6-8 hours = £600-800):**
- Setting up the site structure
- Creating pages for your services, team, contact info
- Adding donation buttons or forms
- Making it mobile-friendly
- Setting up basic SEO

**More complex sites (15-25 hours = £1500-2500):**
- Member login areas
- Event booking systems
- Newsletter integration
- Multiple language support
- Custom forms and workflows

Monthly hosting is **£20** (again, 50% off) for unlimited static sites, or from **£30** for dynamic applications. Compare that to what most charities pay for worse service.

## What you get

Unlike agencies that disappear after launch, I provide ongoing support. Content updates typically go live within 24 hours - just email me the changes. I help with GDPR compliance, cost-saving opportunities, and technical decisions without pushing expensive solutions you don't need.

Your site will be:
- **Fast** - no bloated frameworks slowing things down
- **Accessible** - meeting WCAG2 guidelines for disabled users
- **Secure** - regular backups, no vulnerable plugins
- **Easy to update** - simple process for making changes
- **Properly owned** - you get all the source code

## Giving back

I donate 10% of my income to charity, so your money goes further than just getting a website. I also contribute improvements back to the open source community, helping other charities benefit from the work I do for you.

## Real charity examples

**[Blue Pits Housing Action](/examples/blue-pits/)** - A CQC-registered care provider that was quoted £2500+ by agencies. I built their site for under £800 and they've been with me for 14 years. Updates go live within 24 hours of their email requests.

**[Crumpsall Folk Club](/examples/crumpsall-folk-club/)** - Not a charity but a nonprofit community group that needed an affordable way to share events and build a mailing list without depending on Facebook. Built on Ghost CMS for easy self-management.

Both organisations save thousands each year compared to typical agency pricing, money that goes toward their actual mission instead of tech companies.

## No surprises, no lock-in

Everything is transparent - you'll know exactly what each hour of work involves. The source code is published openly (usually on GitHub), backups are automatic, and you can take your site to another developer anytime. Though after seeing the difference between my approach and typical agency pricing, most charities stick around.
