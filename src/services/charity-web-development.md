# Charity Web Development

**I offer charities and nonprofits a 50% discount on all my web development work** because I believe every organisation should have access to quality technology regardless of budget. I charge **£100 per hour** (half my standard rate) and provide complete transparency about what work is involved.

I've been working with charities and community organisations for over a decade, helping them establish professional online presences that serve their communities effectively.

## Why charities benefit from open source

I use open source technology exclusively. This approach brings several advantages:

- **You own the code** - take it to another developer anytime
- **No license fees** - the software is free, you just pay for the work
- **Community support** - thousands of developers contribute improvements
- **No vendor lock-in** - host anywhere, modify anything
- **Proven technology** - battle-tested by millions of organisations

Open source aligns perfectly with charity values of transparency and community benefit. The same way charities exist to help people rather than make profit, open source software exists to solve problems rather than extract rent.

## Completely transparent pricing

I charge **£100 per hour** for charity work (50% off my standard £200 rate). Here's what typical charity websites cost:

**Basic charity website (6-8 hours = £600-800):**
- Setting up the site structure
- Creating pages for your services, team, contact info
- Adding donation buttons or forms
- Making it mobile-friendly
- Setting up basic SEO

**More complex sites (15-25 hours = £1500-2500):**
- Member login areas
- Event booking systems
- Newsletter integration
- Multiple language support
- Custom forms and workflows

Monthly hosting is **£20** (50% off) for unlimited static sites, or from **£30** for dynamic applications.

## What you get

I provide ongoing support long after your site launches. Content updates typically go live within 24 hours - just email me the changes. I help with GDPR compliance, cost-saving opportunities, and technical decisions, always focused on what best serves your organisation.

Your site will be:
- **Fast** - clean code that loads quickly
- **Accessible** - meeting WCAG2 guidelines for disabled users
- **Secure** - regular backups, maintained software
- **Easy to update** - simple process for making changes
- **Properly owned** - you get all the source code

## Giving back

I donate 10% of my income to charity, so your money goes further than just getting a website. I also contribute improvements back to the open source community, helping other charities benefit from the work I do for you.

## Real charity examples

**[Blue Pits Housing Action](/examples/blue-pits/)** - A CQC-registered care provider and social housing charity I've been supporting for 14 years. Their site provides clear eligibility criteria and all legally required information. Updates go live within 24 hours of their email requests.

**[Freehold Cottage](https://freeholdcottage.com)** - A residential care home in Rochdale providing 24-hour support for adults with mental health conditions. I've hosted their website since 2005, helping them maintain a professional online presence that reflects their commitment to dignity and independence.

**[Newbarn Ltd](https://newbarnltd.co.uk)** - A supported housing organisation providing accommodation and support for vulnerable adults with mental health needs and learning disabilities. I've been hosting their site since 2010, ensuring their services are clearly presented to potential residents and funding bodies.

**[Crumpsall Folk Club](/examples/crumpsall-folk-club/)** - Not a charity but a nonprofit community group that needed an affordable way to share events and build a mailing list without depending on Facebook. Built on Ghost CMS for easy self-management.

Each of these organisations benefits from having full control of their website, transparent costs, and responsive support when they need changes.

## No surprises, no lock-in

Everything is transparent - you'll know exactly what each hour of work involves. The source code is published openly (usually on GitHub), backups are automatic, and you can take your site to another developer anytime. Most charities stay with me long-term because they value the honest approach and reliable service.
