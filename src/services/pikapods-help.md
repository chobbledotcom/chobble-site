# PikaPods Hosting & Advice

[PikaPods.com](https://www.pikapods.com) is an awesome service. Their web interface lets you host your own private instances of popular open source webapps like Nextcloud, Wordpress, PhotoPrism, and dozens more.

This is really handy. I'm a massive nerd so I could get any webapp working on my own servers, but I still choose to pay Pikapods to host apps for me because they make it _really_ straightforward and their prices are really fair.

Hosting with PikaPods instead of my own server means they handle the server infrastructure, the files, the security, updates, etc - it makes it really easy. I use them for my bug-tracking system, my feedback system, my internal CRM, for uptime monitoring, and other bits and bobs.

And aside from my own tools, I also use PikaPods to host the Ghost newsletter platforms for [Crumpsall Folk Club](/examples/crumpsall-folk-club/) and [Southport Organics](/examples/southport-organics/).

## How Can I Help You?

If you'd like your own version of any of the apps that PikaPods hosts ([here's the full list](https://www.pikapods.com/apps)) then **I can help you get them set up**. Once the app is up-and-running there's really not much work to do, since PikaPods handle the updates for you.

Or if you prefer, **I can manage the whole setup for you and host it under my own PikaPods account**. I'll charge you an hourly [setup fee](/prices/) (probably one or two hours depending on the pod) and then monthly fee for maintenance (Â£10) and you won't have to get your hands dirty at all.

## Real Examples

Let's talk specifics. Let's say you're **looking for a CRM** to manage your customer information. I could get you set up with [Twenty](https://twenty.com) - a really flexible customer relationship manager that I use myself and could advise you about.

Or perhaps you want to **publish a newsletter**. I can get you set up with [Ghost](https://ghost.org) so you can send newsletters at a fraction of the cost of the other platforms with way more flexibility.

Maybe you want to **host a discussion forum** for your customers, free from the prying eyes of big tech? [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org) is a tried-and-tested solution.

Or maybe you need some way to **coordinate group meetings** for your organisation? [Rally](https://rallly.co) can do that - or if you need to collaborate on a wiki, I've heard great things about [Wiki.js](https://js.wiki).

**These examples only covers a fraction of the things PikaPods is capable of. Whatever your needs are, there's probably an open source solution out there that I can help you get hosted at low cost. [Drop me a message](/contact/) to talk about your requirements.**
