# Vegan Business Websites

**Get 50% off if you run a vegan business.** That's £100/hour instead of £200/hour, meaning a simple restaurant website design could be as little as **£300**.

My prices are 100% transparent - check out my [price calculator](/price-calculator/). For just **£20/month** to host unlimited vegan static websites with me, you'll get personal support to implement the strategies in my [free marketing guides](/guides/) and [videos](/videos/) to help promote your new website.

I've been vegan since 2009 and vegetarian my whole life so I'm personally invested in helping vegan businesses succeed. I'll help you put your values front and centre to attract visitors Googling for ethical options.

Vegans are savvy searchers - you have to be - so it's important to ensure your site's meta data and social media mentions are up to scratch, and that your listings across social media and places like HappyCow are accurate and complete. I can help with all of that, too.

**If you run a non-vegan restaurant but you still have great vegan options - awesome!** I'll give you plenty of help to highlight those, but unfortunately you won't be eligible for that 50% discount until you've gone 100% veggie!

## Some examples

I build straightforward, fast-loading, and really easy to update websites, hosted on ultra-reliable and low maintenance servers.

<div class="examples">

- ![The homepage of Sally's Bakes, showing a colourful green and pink design with pictures of her cakes and pasties front and centre. There's a Facebook feed, links to social media pages, and "Home", "Menu", "Blog" and "Contact" pages](/assets/examples/sallys-bakes.png) **[Sally's Bakes](/examples/sallys-bakes)** has a site with clear ingredients, HappyCow integration, and simple updates. Her site ranks #1 on Google for all sorts of search terms like "vegan bakery Bury".
- ![Southport Organics website - a dark and simple theme with large graphics](/assets/examples/southport-organics.png) **[Southport Organics](/examples/southport-organics)** aim to avoid Etsy fees with their own direct sales site, with easy product management and full ownership of their newsletter. The site is only fairly new but it's ranking on Google already.
- ![The Vegan Prestwich website homepage, listing business names and links to subcategories 'Delivery/Takeaways', 'Restaurants', 'Shops', 'Tags'](/assets/examples/vegan-prestwich.png) **[Vegan Prestwich](/examples/vegan-prestwich)**, the community platform I run, has grown to 800+ Facebook members and 500+ Instagram followers, and the site gets a steady stream of visitors. We helped convince Joseph Holts to make their beers vegan!
- ![Avo Coffee homepage, showing "Home", "Menu", "About", "Reviews", "News", and "Contact" pages, along with a a photo of the cafe and a welcoming introduction paragraph](/assets/examples/avo-coffee.png) **[Avo Coffee](/examples/avo-coffee/)** isn't a vegan businesses, but they do have great vegan and veggie options. Their website highlights their veggie-friendliness clearly through its text, meta tags, and reviews, and as a result ranks great on Google for vegan-related and other local search terms.
- ![This & That homepage, showing "Home", "Menu", and a photo of the alley where the This & That Indian cafe is hidden away](/assets/examples/this-and-that.png) I've been hosting the **[This & That](/examples/this-and-that/)** site for a nearly a decade now. They offer three vegan curries every day, so I added a [vegan curry page](https://thisandthatcafe.co.uk/vegan-curry/) and made sure they mention it across their web presence. Their site gets thousands of visitors from Google every day!

</div>

I use [Google Search Console](/guides/google-search-console/), [SerpBear results tracking](/videos/serpbear-results-tracking/), Lighthouse audits and years of experience to make sure Google fully understands your site and properly focuses each page towards a specific "vegan" search term. Straightforward, mobile-friendly designs ensure your customers find the information they need quick sharp, reducing "bounce" rates.

## Easy to edit vegan websites

My [Chobble Template](/services/chobble-template/) website builder system makes it really easy to display full ingredient lists, allergen information, and obvious vegan labeling. You'll update everything yourself through the awesome "Pages CMS" editor ([pagescms.org](https://pagescms.org)) - and I'm always just a WhatsApp message away if you get stuck.

## How it works

First, we'll have a free chat about what you need. Then I'll give you a clear quote. Most sites are done within a week, and you'll own everything - I use open source technology so you'll have full control of your source code rather than "renting" access like many web providers.

## Questions?

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I qualify for the vegan discount?</strong></summary>

If your business is primarily vegan or has a significant vegan focus, you qualify. This includes 100% vegan businesses, vegetarian businesses with strong vegan options, businesses transitioning to veganism, or vegan product lines within larger businesses. Not sure? Just ask!

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I'm just starting out?</strong></summary>

Perfect! Getting your website right from the start saves money long-term. I'll help you choose the right domain, set up professional email, and build something that grows with you.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can you help with social media too?</strong></summary>

My expertise is websites, but through Vegan Prestwich I've learned what works on social. I'll share what I know, and my wife (who runs our Instagram) might have tips too.
