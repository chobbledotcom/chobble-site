# Free Marketing Guides & Videos

Trying to get your head around terms like "SEO", "link building", "keywords" or "SERPs" can be overwhelming, and might dissuade you from going "all in" on promoting your website.

I've created a collection of **completely free** marketing guides and videos to help UK small businesses understand search engine optimisation, online marketing, and website maintenance.

All of my content that was previously on Patreon is now available for free:
- Written guides in the [guides section](/guides/)
- Video tutorials in the [videos section](/videos/)
- More videos on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ChobbleDotCom)

## What's Included

- **Actionable tips** that you can implement straight away
- **Detailed guides** on SEO, content creation, and local marketing
- **Video versions** of guides so you can learn in your preferred format
- **Real-world examples** from businesses I've helped
- **British-focused advice** (not American marketing that doesn't work here)
- **No-nonsense explanations** in plain English without the jargon
- **No spammy techniques** that could get your site penalised

## Popular Guides

Here's a sample of what you can learn about:

- [Keywords & Keyword Stuffing](/guides/keywords-and-keyword-stuffing/) - How to use keywords effectively without overdoing it
- [Finding Backlinks](/guides/backlinks/) - Finding quality links from reputable sources
- [Targeting Specific Areas](/guides/targeting-specific-areas/) - Getting found by customers in your region
- [Using AI Effectively](/guides/using-ai-effectively/) - How to use AI tools without hurting your site's credibility
- [Google Business](/guides/google-business/) - Setting up and optimising your Google Maps listing
- [SEO Checklist](/guides/checklist/) - A practical, prioritised list of SEO tasks

Each guide is written specifically for UK businesses, with practical advice that works in our market. I focus on techniques that are sustainable long-term and won't get your site penalised when Google updates its algorithms.

## Who Is This For?

These resources are perfect for:

- Small business owners who want more enquiries from their website
- People who are willing to put in a bit of work but need direction
- Anyone who wants to understand online marketing without the fluff
- UK-based businesses looking for advice that works in our market
- Folks who might have tried random tips from YouTube with little success

As a full-time nerd who has been helping businesses improve their online presence for decades, I can help you make the most of the time you spend working on your web presence.

## The Chobble Approach to Marketing

I believe in honest, sustainable marketing that prioritises providing real value to your visitors. I will never tell you to:

- Stuff keywords into your content unnaturally
- Buy dodgy backlinks that could harm your site
- Use manipulative techniques that will eventually backfire
- Waste money on services that don't deliver results

Instead, I focus on helping you understand what your customers are actually looking for, and how to provide that to them in a way that Google will recognise and reward.

## Need Personal Support?

While all the guides and videos are free, **website customers get personal support** to help them understand and implement these strategies. I'm available to answer specific questions about your situation and help you apply the advice to your business.

Whether you're based in Prestwich or anywhere else in the UK, I'm sure I can help, regardless of your industry.
