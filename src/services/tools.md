# Tools, Widgets, & Doodads

I've made lots of different widgets and tools over the years. Most have been lost to the sands of time or are owned by companies I used to work for, but I'm still hosting a few. Listed in order of usefulness.

## Portable Appliance Test Logger

- **[patlog.co.uk](https://patlog.co.uk)**

> "Portable appliance testing (PAT inspection or PAT testing) is a process by which electrical appliances are routinely checked for safety." [~Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_appliance_testing)

I made a simple, free website where users can log PAT tests with accompanying PDF certificates and QR code links. It also explains that PAT tests might not be necessary on its 'about' page.

## Checkatrade Review Scraper

- [source code](https://git.chobble.com/chobble/chobble-site/raw/branch/main/src/tools/checkatrade-reviews.md)

There's no straightforward way to export reviews from Checkatrade, so I built a tool to do it. You might use these in your static site, or to analyse them, or whatevs - it's your data, so you should be able to use it.

## Google Review Links / QR Code Generator

- **[/tools/google-reviews](/tools/google-reviews)**
- [source code](https://git.chobble.com/chobble/chobble-site/raw/branch/main/src/tools/google-reviews.md)

Shortly after I made this tool to find the _"Leave a Review"_ and _"Read Reviews"_ links for Google Maps listings, they released their own in-house method of doing it and emailed me about it for the Chobble listing! Bah.
