# Linux Conversions in Prestwich & Manchester

Linux is a **community-made operating system** - an alternative to Microsoft's "Windows". If your Windows PC is running slow, or you're tired of Microsoft's bloat and adverts, and you want to feel in control of your computer - I can install Linux on it and give it new life.

I'm in Prestwich but can travel around Manchester, or you can come to me.

## Pricing

The base price is **£200 for an hour's work, or £100 if discounted for charities, coops, artists, and sustainable businesses** ([see my charity web development services](/services/charity-web-development/)).

An hour is probably plenty of time to wipe everything and get Linux up and running on one computer - but that price will be higher if you need me to handle backups and restores, as these can take a long time.

So - for the best price, handle your own backups. You should have a good backup strategy, anyway - [I can help](/contact/) if you don't.

## Why switch to Linux?

People often tell me their Windows machine has "gone slow" - either just because **Windows is bloated with stuff you rarely use**, or else because **resource-heavy drivers** from printers and scanners are constantly running in the background.

In 2025 people have also been frustrated that **Windows 11 won't run** on their perfectly good but "unsupported" machine, plus growing **privacy concerns** about Microsoft's data collection, forced Copilot software, and ads. With Windows 10 support ending in October 2025, millions of perfectly good computers are at risk of becoming e-waste. If you're not in Manchester, check out [endof10.org](https://endof10.org/) to find someone near you who can help you switch to Linux.

Linux is people-centred rather than profit-centred. It's flexible, straightforward, and doesn't treat you like a product to squeeze money from. Its customisability means you can choose a flavour of Linux which suits your hardware, and older computers are supported for much longer than Microsoft or Apple offer.

## Success stories

**The super low maintenance computer:** I set my friend up with a tiny Ubuntu machine which plugged into his TV and which he used for web browsing and YouTube - and it was still ticking along 10+ years later, updating itself silently in the background and requiring no maintenance.

**Reviving an exhausted Windows laptop:** A community organisation was working from a low-cost and underpowered (for Windows) laptop, paying each month for expensive Microsoft licenses. I installed Ubuntu and switched to LibreOffice (a free Microsoft Office alternative) with Nextcloud backups, which made the laptop run as though it was brand new.

**The savvy retiree:** I helped a retiree build a [Framework laptop](/services/framework-laptops/) to their custom specification. They were keen to become a more savvy internet user after seeing friends fall victim to online scams. We installed Ubuntu Linux, learned about the Bitwarden password manager, and the owner now feels confident browsing the internet.

**The gaming machine:** I built a gaming desktop with a high-end graphics card, running Pop!\_OS ([system76.com/pop](https://system76.com/pop/)), a Linux "distribution" tweaked especially for gaming and ease of use. Its youngster owner had no problem getting to grips with the "alternative" operating system.

## What I can help with

For **laptop and desktop conversions**, I typically do full Windows replacement with Ubuntu (recommended for beginners), handle data migration from whatever software you're currently using, and check hardware compatibility with advice on printer/scanner support. My turnaround is quick - usually 1-2 days maximum.

I collect and deliver throughout North Manchester - Prestwich, Bury, Whitefield, Radcliffe, and across the wider Manchester area. There's no need to travel to me unless you're outside the region.

## The conversion process

My process is straightforward: If requested, I start with **data backup** to preserve all your documents, photos, and important files, then do the **Ubuntu installation** as a complete Windows replacement with the latest Long Term Support version. Next comes **software setup** where I install free alternatives to your existing programs and Firefox with ad-blocking built in. I follow up with **hardware testing** to ensure everything works properly before handover, and finish with **basic training** to show you the essentials so you can get started confidently.

## Honest hardware advice

A minority of computer peripherals only work with Windows - if that's your situation, I can help you find better, universally-compatible alternatives. In the very rare case that this isn't an option, you might be stuck with Windows. Boo!
