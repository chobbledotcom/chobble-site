# Website Content Advice

**Summary: I will spend [an hour](/prices/) giving your site a once-over, to create a list of tasks to do in priority order - plus how long it would take me to do each. fill in the form below if this sounds like a good fit for your site!**

When I talk to small business owners about improving their existing websites they often feel overwhelmed by the apparent size of the task ahead of them.

This doesn't need to be the case - marketing your site is all about making small, continuous improvements. You don't need to do everything at once, which means you can just focus on the next task ahead of you.

## How it works

I can look at your website from the point of view of both search engines and potential customers, and build a prioritised list of "things to fix". I'll also provide an estimate for how long it would take _me_ to fix the job - and you can decide whether to pay me, or just do the work yourself.

I'll work on compiling this list for an hour, and will aim to generate around 10-20 ideas of things that need fixing. The result might look something like:

> 1. **(10 mins) Tidy top navigation links.** The main links on your website are messy and difficult for visitors to read. You should tidy these up so they fit on one line, and less important links are moved elsewhere.
> 2. **(30 mins) Fix homepage content.** Your homepage text is a big block of writing which is hard to scan and which repeats its "SEO" keywords in an unnatural way. This will dissuade visitors who read it from choosing you. You should re-write this page so it sounds more natural (see my [keywords guide](/guides/keywords-and-keyword-stuffing/)), and break up big chunks of text with paragraphs, headings, bold text, links, and bullet point lists.
> 3. **(10 mins) Fix contact page content.** Your contact page doesn't mention some of the important ways to contact you, and it contains a lot of "SEO optimised" text which pushes the contact form off the page. This will dissuade visitors from using the contact form. You should re-write it to include crucial information, while remaining concise.
> 4. **(20 mins) Fix your Widgets category text.** Etcetera, etcetera.

## Who is this for?

This is aimed at small business owners who are keen to improve their website, but don't know where to start - you might think of yourself as "not being technical", or you might find some of the terminology around "Search Engine Optimisation" confusing.

If you're already "mostly on top" of your site's content and are looking for an edge, you may be more interested in my [SEO audits](/services/seo-audits/) service which is a more technical deep-dive into your site's structure.

## Will this cover everything I ever need to do?

No. Promoting your business is an ongoing job, and you should never think of your website as "finished". My advice will give you a good idea of some next steps to do - and hopefully you can run with my advice once you've finished them, because I will explain why each is neccessary.

## Will you do the fixes?

I'm happy to make the changes for you! While I would prefer for you to take charge of your own content because I think it gives the best long term results, I realise that some people just don't have the time.

You'll need to give me access to your site's control panel, and if I'm writing new content I might need to ask you some questions about your business. I'll write in a natural way that avoids [keyword stuffing](/guides/keywords-and-keyword-stuffing/) while still helping you rank well.

## Can we meet in Prestwich to discuss this?

Sure! We can even make the changes together - although it will probably take longer because I'll be explaining as I go. If you're local to Prestwich, this could be a really good way for you to figure out a long term content improvement plan - and to learn about "search engine optimisation" at the same time.

We can either meet at my house, your house or business, or a local cafe where we can sit for a couple of hours with a laptop. I recommend Cuckoo, All The Shapes, or Goods In - all have delicious coffee and cakes too!

## How does payment work?

You will pay **100% up front for my initial read over your site**. If you decide to employ to make the fixes, you'll pay **50% before I start**, and the remaining **50% when I've finished**.
