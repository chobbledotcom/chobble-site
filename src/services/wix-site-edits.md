# Stuck With Your Wix Site? I Can Help

**The problem with Wix isn't that it's rubbish** - it's that the interface can feel completely overwhelming. Because Wix supports everything under the sun, finding what you actually need feels like hunting for a needle in a haystack. There's often three different and non-obvious ways to do the same thing.

If you've got graphic design skills, you can make a Wix site look decent. But making it perform well is where most people get stuck. Wix imports loads of JavaScript libraries whether you need them or not, which makes sites feel sluggish. Getting around these limitations means reading and understanding lots of technical documentation - which is where I come in.

## What I Actually Do For Wix Users

**I'm not affiliated with Wix** - which means I'll give you honest advice about whether staying on their platform makes sense for your business. My job is to save you money and headaches in the long run, not upsell you anything.

Here's how I help with Wix sites:

**Navigate the overwhelming interface** - I'll dig through Wix's menus to help you set up the features you need, whether that's eCommerce, booking systems, member areas, or fancy galleries.

**Make sense of their documentation** - Years of working with APIs and technical docs means I can translate Wix's often confusing instructions into actionable steps.

**Improve site performance** - I'll identify what's slowing your site down and work within Wix's constraints to speed things up where possible.

**Export your data safely** - If you decide Wix isn't right for you, I can help extract your content and get it ready for a better platform.

## Specific Wix Features I Can Set Up

If you need any of these implemented on your Wix site, I can dig through their interface and documentation to get them working properly:

- **Online stores** using Wix eCommerce with payment processing and inventory management
- **Booking systems** with Wix Scheduling for appointments, classes, or events
- **Member-only areas** using Wix's permissions system for exclusive content
- **Product databases** that populate your site automatically from spreadsheets or APIs
- **Media galleries** for photos, videos, or music with proper optimization
- **Contact forms** with custom fields, validation, and email automation
- **Blog integration** with SEO-friendly URLs and social sharing
- **Third-party integrations** connecting Wix to other tools you use
- **Custom animations** and interactive elements (within Wix's constraints)
- **Multi-language sites** with proper URL structure and content management

The full scope of what's possible is huge - [Wix's developer documentation](https://dev.wix.com/) gives you an idea of just how much functionality they pack in. The problem is that finding and configuring what you actually need can take hours of clicking through menus and reading confusing help articles.

## The Honest Truth About Wix

Wix works fine if your website isn't crucial to your business and you're happy with the ongoing costs. But if your site is an important sales funnel, you'll quickly hit its limitations. **Wix can change their prices or break your site's functionality overnight** - I've seen customers whose sites suddenly stopped working after Wix changed how their JavaScript worked. When they complained, Wix blamed the customer.

This kind of nightmare simply can't happen with a [static website](/services/static-websites) built to your specifications. If long-term stability and cost control matter to your business, consider a [website migration](/services/website-migrations) to cheaper, more reliable hosting.

## Remote Wix Help - No Lengthy Contracts

All Wix work is done remotely. You'll give me temporary access to your site, I'll crack on with the work, then explain exactly what I did in as much detail as you want. **I charge by the hour with transparent pricing** - probably much cheaper than Wix's dedicated support or ongoing consultant fees.

**Need broader website strategy advice?** I've used Wix, WordPress, Squarespace, and I've built at least a hundred custom websites in my career. My [technical consultancy](/services/technical-advice) service can help you choose the right platform for your actual needs, not just what's easiest to sell you.

**Already know your site needs improvement but not sure where to start?** A [website content audit](/services/website-content-advice) will give you a prioritised list of what's actually worth fixing.

**Worried about technical SEO issues?** My [SEO audit service](/services/seo-audits/) uses industry-standard tools to identify performance problems that Wix's built-in analytics won't show you.

## Local Wix Help in Prestwich & Manchester

While all my Wix work can be done remotely, **if you're based in Prestwich or nearby areas of Manchester**, I'm happy to meet up for a proper chat about your website strategy. Sometimes it's easier to explain complex technical concepts face-to-face, especially when we're weighing up whether to stick with Wix or move to something better.

I can meet you at a local café, your office, or wherever suits you best. This works particularly well if you're trying to decide between platforms or need to understand the long-term implications of your website choices. **No obligation** - I'm always happy to help local businesses make informed decisions, even if that means recommending you sort your Wix issues yourself rather than paying me.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How much does Wix help cost compared to just paying Wix directly?**

A: I charge by the hour with no ongoing fees, which often works out much cheaper than Wix's premium support or hiring a Wix Partner who'll want monthly retainers. A typical "I can't figure out how to set up my booking system" job might take 2-3 hours of my time versus months of wrestling with it yourself or paying someone £200+ per month indefinitely.

**Q: My Wix site is really slow - can you fix that?**

A: I can definitely help identify what's slowing it down and work within Wix's constraints to improve things. But honestly? Wix sites are inherently heavy because they load tons of JavaScript whether you need it or not. If site speed is crucial for your business, you might be better off with a [static website](/services/static-websites) that loads in milliseconds rather than seconds.

**Q: Should I stick with Wix or move to something else?**

A: Depends entirely on your needs and tolerance for ongoing costs. Wix is fine for hobby sites or businesses where the website isn't a critical sales tool. But if your site generates revenue, the performance limitations and vendor lock-in become expensive problems. I'll give you honest advice about whether it makes financial sense to stay or [migrate elsewhere](/services/website-migrations).

**Q: What if I want to leave Wix later - will I lose everything?**

A: Not if you plan ahead. I can export your content, images, and data in formats that work with other platforms. The sooner you make this change, the easier it is. Leaving Wix after five years of adding content is much more complex than leaving after one.

**Q: How does remote Wix work actually work?**

A: You'll give me temporary editor access to your Wix site (not your login details - Wix has proper collaboration tools). I'll do the work, document exactly what I changed, then remove my access. You stay in control of your site throughout. Most jobs take a few hours to a couple of days depending on complexity.

**Q: Is it worth paying for Wix's own premium support?**

A: Wix support will only help you use Wix tools in ways Wix approves of. They won't tell you if a different platform would suit you better, or help you work around Wix's limitations. I'm not trying to sell you a Wix subscription, so I can give you genuinely unbiased advice about what makes sense for your business.

**Q: What can't be fixed on Wix?**

A: Wix's fundamental architecture - you can't make it load as fast as a properly built static site, and you can't escape their hosting costs. If those are deal-breakers, no amount of tweaking will solve them. I'll be upfront about what's possible and what isn't.

**Q: How do you know which platform is best for different businesses?**

A: I've built sites on everything - Wix, Squarespace, WordPress, and hundreds of custom static sites. I've seen what works for different types of businesses and budgets. My [technical consultancy](/services/technical-advice) service exists specifically to help people make informed platform decisions without the sales pressure.

**Q: What happens if Wix breaks my site again like you mentioned?**

A: You're stuck with whatever Wix decides to do - it's their platform, their rules. This is why I always discuss the risks of platform dependency with clients. With a static site, you control the code and hosting, so this scenario simply can't happen.

**Q: I just want a simple brochure site - should I even bother with Wix?**

A: Probably not. Wix's interface is overkill for simple sites, and you'll pay monthly fees forever for features you don't need. A [static website](/services/static-websites) would cost less upfront, load faster, and have no ongoing hosting fees. Save Wix for when you actually need dynamic features like booking systems or member areas.
