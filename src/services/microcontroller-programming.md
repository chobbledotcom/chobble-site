# Microcontroller Programming

My home is full of devices like ESP32 microcontrollers, WLED strips, Tasmota lights, and ZigBee nodes.

I've hacked away on Home Assistant, Node-RED, and similar systems for many years and have become familiar with the practicalities of microcontrollers, writing scripts in MicroPython and flashing firmwares to interface with the real world through open source and interoperable protocols.

## What does that mean?

If you'd like to "smart"-ify the electronics in your home or business, I can help you. I can install tiny, self-contained, open source chips that connect to wireless networks, log sensor data, toggle relays or switches, or power motors. I can build web interfaces to control them, which you can host on your own secure infrastructure or with me.

## Who might be interested in this?

If your day-to-day business involves electronic devices and you want to customise the way they behave, then drop me a message through the contact form on this page. I'm not an electrician but I can work with you to figure out what's possible and get a prototype working.

## What are some real examples?

Here's a few projects I've worked on recently:

- **Smart lighting** which reacts to the weather outdoors, motion, the sun, or all three.
- **An automated dehumidifier** programmed to run fron surplus solar electricity, by reading data from the relay.
- **An online arcade machine** connected to a web server to allow remote control of a previously offline device.
- **CCTV Systems** with motion detection, viewable via a secure private VPN, hosted on your own server.
- **Mesh WiFi networks** with 6ghz backbones for high-speed internet across multiple building floors.
- **Web filters** which block, log, or filter internet traffic across your whole network, managed via a simple web interface.

## Are you in Prestwich?

If you're local to Prestwich, even better! We can test your device together on-premises. And if we need to work with a local electrician, I know one who can help who is familiar with microcontrollers.

## Let's talk!

If this sounds good then **drop me a message through the contact form on this page to get the ball rolling**. We'll come up with a plan, build a prototype, and iterate on it until we've got something perfect for your needs.

I use open source tools which give you complete ownership over your data and code, so you'll own it forever.
