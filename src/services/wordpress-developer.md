# WordPress Developer

**Need a WordPress site that you fully control? I'll build you one with open source plugins, from as low as £400.**

I've been building WordPress sites for over 15 years. I've used it for everything - metal album review sites, headless CMS backends, custom themes for businesses, you name it. I even migrated [This & That](/examples/this-and-that/#content) from WordPress to static when they needed something simpler.

These days I build clean WordPress installations using quality open source plugins. No vendor lock-in, no mysterious annual fees, just WordPress that works.

## My WordPress Experience

I've been working with WordPress since the late 2000s. Over the years I've:

- Built custom themes from scratch for various businesses
- Used WordPress as a headless CMS for custom frontends
- Run my own WordPress sites (including a metal album review blog that got decent traffic)
- Migrated sites both to and from WordPress when it made sense
- Set up WooCommerce shops, membership sites, and booking systems

I know WordPress and its alternatives like [static site generators](/services/static-websites/#content) well - both its strengths and its limitations. **If you're in Prestwich or Manchester**, we can meet for coffee and I'll give you honest advice about whether WordPress is right for your needs.

## How it works

1. **Free chat** - We discuss what you need, either by phone or over coffee if you're local
2. **Clear quote** - I'll tell you exactly how many hours it'll take and what's involved
3. **Quick build** - Most WordPress sites are ready within a week
4. **You own everything** - Full access to your code, content, and hosting

The beauty of my pricing is you decide how much work you want to do yourself. Pick your own theme and write your own content? Your site could be ready in 2 hours for **£400** (or **£200** with my charity discount). Need me to handle everything? That's fine too.

## WordPress Development Services

I can help with all aspects of WordPress development:

- **New WordPress sites** built from scratch with exactly the features you need
- **Custom theme development** tailored to your brand
- **WooCommerce shops** with payment processing and inventory management
- **Membership sites** with subscriber content and payment integration
- **WordPress migrations** from WordPress.com or expensive hosts - see my [website migrations](/services/website-migrations/#content) page
- **Performance optimisation** to keep your site running fast
- **Headless WordPress** setups for custom frontends

## Simple WordPress Hosting with PikaPods

I recommend PikaPods for WordPress hosting because it makes everything remarkably straightforward. Your WordPress site runs in its own container with automatic updates, and I'll set up daily backups to two separate providers for extra redundancy.

Read more about [how I use PikaPods](/services/pikapods-help/#content) to host various applications. The setup takes about an hour and then your site just runs. You're free to host anywhere though - I've set up WordPress on pretty much every hosting provider over the years.

## WordPress for Charities and Local Businesses

**Charities get 50% off** - £100 per hour instead of £200. This discount also applies to cooperatives, artists, musicians, vegan businesses, and renewable energy companies. See my [charity web development](/services/charity-web-development/#content) page for details.

WordPress works particularly well for organisations that need:

- Member portals with different access levels
- Event management and booking systems
- Donation processing
- Newsletter integration
- Multi-author blogs

The open source approach means you own everything outright with no recurring software costs beyond hosting.

**WordPress project examples:**

- **Basic setup** (2 hours = £400): WordPress installation, standard theme, you write the content
- **Simple business site** (4-6 hours = £800-1200): I set up pages, basic plugins, you provide content
- **Full business website** (10-15 hours = £2000-3000): Custom theme work, I help with content
- **Restaurant website with booking** (8-12 hours = £1600-2400)
- **WooCommerce shop** (20-30 hours = £4000-6000)
- **Membership site** (15-25 hours = £3000-5000)
- **WordPress migration** (4-8 hours = £800-1600)

**Monthly hosting options:**

- **£10 per month** - Basic hosting for confident users. You totally handle your own content and SEO. Good for straightforward sites that rarely change.
- **£60 per month** (£30 with discount) - Full support including updates, backups, Google Search Console monitoring, SEO advice, and help when you need it.

You can even start with full support while you're learning, then downgrade to basic once you're comfortable.

## Questions?

<details>
<summary><strong>I already have a WordPress site - can you help?</strong></summary>

Absolutely. I can optimise existing sites, migrate them to better hosting, update ancient installations, or help you escape from WordPress.com's limitations. I'll give you honest advice about whether to fix what you have or start fresh.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why open source plugins only?</strong></summary>

Premium plugins often stop working when you stop paying, leaving you stuck. Open source plugins are free forever, maintained by the community, and you're never held hostage by license fees. I use established plugins like WooCommerce, Contact Form 7, and Yoast that have proven track records.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What about page builders like Elementor?</strong></summary>

I can work with them if you insist, but I prefer clean code. Page builders make sites slower and harder to maintain. A well-built theme with the block editor gives you flexibility without the bloat.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can you build custom plugins?</strong></summary>

Yes - although it might be pricey! But sure - if you need something specific that doesn't exist in the plugin directory, I can build it for you.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>WordPress vs static sites - which is better?</strong></summary>

WordPress is brilliant when you need user accounts, e-commerce, or multiple people updating content regularly. But if you just need a straightforward business site, my [static websites](/services/static-websites/#content) are faster, easier to edit, and more flexible. Not sure? My [technical consultancy](/services/technical-advice/#content) service can help you decide.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do you do ongoing maintenance?</strong></summary>

Yes - £60/month (£30 with discount) covers updates, backups, search engine monitoring, and SEO support and advice. Or £10/month if you just want hosting and backups but prefer to handle everything else yourself.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I want to leave later?</strong></summary>

No problem - you own everything. I'll provide a full export of your site, database, and all files. You can take it to any other developer or host - I'll even help you (at my hourly rate).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can you help with SEO?</strong></summary>

I can set up Yoast SEO and make sure your site is technically sound for search engines. For content strategy and ongoing SEO work, check out my [SEO audits](/services/seo-audits/#content) service and free [marketing guides](/guides/#content).
